>> Good afternoon. Committee will come to order. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a recess at any time. Today, the rules committee is convening to consider a single measure. H.R. 3838, the streamlining procurement for effective execution and delivery, and national defense authorization act for fiscal year 2026. You guys couldn't come up with a shorter name for it. Um, we'll certainly hear a lot of robust discussion on the legislation before us today. So I'll keep my opening comments brief. Congress. His first duty is to provide for the common defense of the nation. It's a constitutional mandate. We're charged with upholding. The ndaa undergirds America's national defense policy. It works to ensure that America's armed forces remain the best equipped and prepared in the 

[2:04:50 PM]

entire world. It has always been a bipartisan effort, one that helps the men and women who defend our nation achieve their mission, whether by land, sea or air. The fy 26 ndaa furthers the strong commitments of congress and president trump to build a ready, capable, and lethal fighting force that will effectively deter our nation's adversaries. It codifies all or parts of 15 separate executive orders issued by president trump that relate to fortifying our nation's national security and defense postures. Further, this legislation yields $20 billion in savings, including 15 billion from reforms spearheaded by doj's works to improve the quality of life for the nation's service members. With a 3.8% pay raise and improved benefits for military 

[2:05:52 PM]

families. Cuts bureaucratic red tape that threatens our nation's competitive advantage on the world stage. And equips the nation's warfighters with the capabilities they need in the most cost effective manner possible. The fy 26 ndaa also makes commitments to deter aggression from rogue regimes such as China, Russia, Iran and foreign terrorist organizations that pose a serious threat to America's national security and our way of life. This legislation would not be possible without the bipartisan, collaborative efforts of the members and staff of the armed services committee. As this process now moves to the rules committee and soon to the floor for full consideration, I expect the same level of bipartisanship and collaboration will be present, with many Republicans and Democrats coming to testify here today. We'll be presented 

[2:06:54 PM]

with a wide range of ideas that will receive fair consideration. With that, I look forward to today's discussion. And I now yield to the ranking member, Mr. Mcgovern, for any comments that he wishes to make. >> Well, thank you, madam chair. Um, so before us this week is the national defense authorization act. Uh, last year, Republicans turned what was supposed to be a national security funding bill into a right wing wish list. They loaded it up with attacks on reproductive rights. They targeted lgbtq service members. They went after diversity programs in the military. It wasn't about defense. It wasn't about protecting this country. It was all about playing politics with our national defense. And I fear it will be the exact same thing this year. The same extremist playbook passed out of committee with bipartisan support. Then blow it up on the house floor with a pile of culture war garbage that has nothing to do with keeping America safe. So let's be clear this isn't about 

[2:07:54 PM]

national defense. It's about political theater. It's about turning the department of defense. Excuse me, the department of war. Since Donald Trump apparently changed the name into a campaign prop. Kind of interesting that the president who says he wants a Nobel prize, uh, Nobel peace prize is fantasizing about war. Uh, but I guess that makes sense, coming from the guy who's never actually been in a war because he had bone spurs. And just this weekend, he posted, and I quote Chicago about to find out why it's called the department of war. Let that sink in. The sitting president threatening to use the us military to wage war on an American city against American citizens. That's not leadership. That's nuts. Imagine if president Obama tweeted out that he was going to war with Republican led cities. You guys would be having a meltdown. And putting all that aside. I'll tell you this I don't vote for the ndaa. I think I might have voted yes on the ndaa once in my entire career. And the reason why is 

[2:08:55 PM]

quite simple. I refuse to send nearly $1 trillion to an agency that can't even pass an audit. The Pentagon loses track of an insane amount of taxpayer money year after year, and we reward them with more. No, that's not defense. That's insanity. This the stuff they overpay for is insane. The air force paid a $150,000 markup on soap dispensers, $1,500 for a single coffee cup. Those aren't just numbers I made up. They came from the very conservative heritage foundation. Imagine if we invested all those billions of wasted dollars here at home, on ending hunger, on housing, on or education, or making people's lives better, but instead we're stuck in this circus. And speaking of circuses, let's talk about the Epstein files. Despite the best efforts of my friends on the other side, this issue is not going to go away. Republicans are doing everything they can to stall, distract, and cover up. Republicans on oversight touted releasing new records, 

[2:09:55 PM]

but vast majority the vast majority of the documents they released were already public. Up in Massachusetts, we call that a scam. And while survivors stood outside the capitol begging for justice, sharing their painful stories, Donald Trump sat in the oval office calling the whole thing, quote, irrelevant. I still can't believe he said, that the victims are begging for transparency, begging for us to pass the Marcy Kaptur bill, begging for this administration to release the files. And the president of the United States, the most powerful person in the world, says that they are irrelevant, says it's all a hoax. It wasn't a hoax when trump promised to release all the files. It wasn't a hoax when his own ally said that they had the client list sitting on the on the on their desk and were ready to make it public. And now get this. Speaker Mike Johnson said Donald Trump was an FBI informant on this case. I'm not surprised the speaker walked it back, because usually an informant knows something about what's going on. Being an informant implies being in on the crime. So again, we really, 

[2:10:56 PM]

really, really need to know what the hell is in those files. And we need Republicans to stop shielding the powerful and start standing with the survivors. It's simple. Republicans can either sign the bipartisan Marcy Kaptur discharge petition or better yet, put the bill on the floor this week, which will finally give the public the full truth. Or they can keep burying it. No more stalling, no more excuses, no more cover ups. Release the files. I yield back. >> Thank you, Mr. Mcgovern. Um. Without objection, any prepared statements? Statements that are witnesses may have will be included in the record. I now welcome our first panel. Chairman Rogers and ranking member Smith from the committee on armed services. Your full statement will be submitted for the record. We ask that you summarize your statement in five minutes. Chairman Rogers, I welcome your testimony. >> Thank you. Chairman and ranking member Mcgovern, for having, uh, having us here today. I want to thank your 

[2:11:57 PM]

staff, as well as you, for helping us get this ndaa to the floor this year. Uh, I also want to thank my friend and colleague Adam Smith, who's been a great partner in running this this armed services committee and getting us this product. I'm very proud of the work we did to put this bill together in a bipartisan fashion and in our committee. That's not just a term that we use loosely. We actually work in a bipartisan fashion. The bill before you today is called the streamlining, procurement and effective execution and delivery act, or speed act. Um, and we did that to underscore the very significant reforms this bill makes to the defense acquisition process. The Pentagon's current acquisition process is failing our warfighters. It can take up to ten years between identifying a battlefield need and delivering a solution to the warfighter. By the time by that time, the threat has changed, the cost of balloon and the solution is outdated. The speed act includes a series of reforms to eliminate regulatory burdens and bureaucratic inertia, and 

[2:12:59 PM]

put in place a system that will deliver capability to the warfighter at the speed of scale. Fixing acquisitions will go a long way toward ensuring our warfighters are the most capable fighting force on the planet. I also want to highlight our continued effort to improve the quality of life of our service members and their families that we initiated last year. Uh, among other improvements, we provide a 3.8% pay raise for all service members, authorized nearly $3 billion in construction for new housing, dining facilities and medical facilities, child care centers and schools, improved service, member access to medical and mental health services. We also remain laser focused on deterring adversaries like China. The bill invests in the capabilities we need to stay ahead of our adversaries. The maintenance and logistics systems we need to conduct operations and the capacity, capacity of our allies so they can assist on the battlefield. Uh, this is a strong bipartisan bill that puts our warfighters first. It builds the ready, 

[2:14:00 PM]

capable, and lethal fighting force. We need to deter our adversaries and ensure peace through strength. I urge all members to support it, and I yield back. >> Thank you, madam chair. Uh, I want to echo the chairman's comments thanking that the rules committee. They've always been a great partner in this process. I don't know exactly how many amendments have been submitted, but I think it's north of 1200 at this point. Um, really appreciate your working so closely with our staff on that process. And I also want to thank the chairman for his leadership of the committee. He's absolutely right. Uh, we work in a very bipartisan fashion. We produce a bipartisan product out of committee. Uh, I wrote, I think, 57 to 2, 56 to 2, something like that. Um, and it is a really good product that we should be proud of. And the chairman highlighted the number one most important thing in it this year, and that is acquisition reform. Now we have made sort of incremental progress on some aspects of acquisition reform before. But chairman Rogers and the committee really committed this cycle to doing a deep dive on 

[2:15:02 PM]

what's wrong and how to fix it. We had a hearing out in silicon valley. We had hearings down in Austin, Texas. We met with industry reps and a whole lot of other people to figure out how can we make this work better. And the result is the speed act. The chairman has put together that I think is going to make a huge difference. And just to understand why it's important, innovation is absolutely crucial to national security right now. We have to be able to acquire the most innovative, up to date systems quickly. Uh, the Pentagon moves too slowly. And when you're looking at technologies like drones and I, uh, and all manner of different other systems, we need to buy those more quickly. This bill, I think, really gives us a good chance to get there. And I appreciate that effort. Also, as the chairman referenced, we continue the efforts from the previous cycle when we focused on quality of life issues. We did a quality of life task force that gave us a series of recommendations, which we can all be proud were implemented in last year's bill and that we build on that in the way the chairman said. The other area that I want to emphasize is there is strong support for Ukraine in this bill and strong 

[2:16:03 PM]

support for eastern Europe. Uh, we have $400 million in said for Ukraine specifically. And also we reinforce the support for the baltic nations with the baltic defense initiative by putting money in there specifically for that. I think it is an enormous mistake by the trump administration to signal that they are going to cut those funds and do have raised so many questions about our continuing support to Ukraine. Showing weakness to Vladimir Putin is not the way to end this war. We need to support Ukraine. That is what will force Putin to the bargaining table and end this war. And I think this bill reflects those priorities. Two broad areas of concern that I think this bill should do a better job of on oversight. President has used the united States military to an unprecedented level, both for domestic law enforcement and for border security. Now, both of those things are very important. Do not get me wrong, but the United States military has a very specific mission to 

[2:17:04 PM]

defend ourselves against our foreign adversaries. The billions and billions of dollars that are being spent on the border, a border that I must emphasize that the president says is secure right now. And I happen to agree with him on that point. So why are we spending billions and billions of more dollars, both on military construction and on the use of our troops time in that mission, while undermining our mission to deter ourselves against adversaries like Russia, Iran and North Korea and competitors like China? I think that is misplaced. I think we need to place more emphasis on that. And also the president's use of the military for domestic law enforcement is shocking and alarming. It should be shocking and alarming to everybody in congress. The posse comitatus law is there for a reason. This is being violated. And then when it comes to expanding the authority of dod, the president has apparently unilaterally declared war on every drug cartel in the world. What is that going to drag us into? 

[2:18:04 PM]

What is the justification for the attack that happened in the caribbean just last week? We have not heard it yet. I think this is a dangerous expansion that undermines congress, but also places the country at jeopardy. Other area of concern is on the culture war issue. We have fought through this with with culture wars on the left that I didn't agree with, and a culture war on the right now that I don't agree with efforts to rename, um, the bases back to the names for confederate generals. Um, the purging of some 24,000 images that showed diversity, equity and inclusion, which I love, the example that they actually purged briefly, pictures of the Enola gay because they were trying to ban the word gay. First of all, it's kind of stupid because, you know, it's the Enola gay. It means something different. But second of all, why are we wasting time trying to get rid of the word gay in the first place, even based on the other meaning that does not advance the interests of the warfighter, or get us to the point where we're going to meet our 

[2:19:05 PM]

national security needs. I also think we need to exercise oversight over the the doj's process and the reform efforts. Too much of that seemed to be focused primarily on breaking the government, making it not work, and also on making sure that personal loyalty to president trump was the only thing that mattered. We fired all of the inspector generals, all of the judge advocate generals, all of the people who are supposed to exercise independent oversight, not to mention the dozen or so generals who were fired based on, apparently, the whims of Laura Loomer. That does not build a strong national security defense. And one item that I hope people will consider if you want to consider everything I just said is being unduly partizan. When dodge came in and gave everyone the offer to take early retirement and leave, a lot of them did, and we lost some 75% of our cyber experts in dod because we spent all this money training them. They had this highly marketable expertise. And then they came along and said, hey, we'll pay you to 

[2:20:05 PM]

leave. And they said, okay, we'll take your money. We'll go make more money on the outside. And now we don't have the cyber intelligence we need. Just because the focus was on purging the federal workforce, not on making it more efficient and more effective. And the last thing that I hope this committee will consider, um, Mr. Mcgovern referenced this in the rules process last year. The committee wound up ruling in order all manner of different extreme right wing amendments that fundamentally broke the bipartisan nature of the bill. And I hope we don't do that again. And just again, note to bipartisanship. I remember the first year when I was chairman, 2019, we kind of did the same thing. It was complicated. We took a big swing. It was our first time in charge in eight years. Um, and we made a bill that ultimately Republicans didn't vote for. So that's one year. The next year, we put together a very bipartisan bill that got a bipartisan vote on the committee. I'm very hopeful that the rules committee will look at that as well. Put aside the cultural war, put aside the partizan issues, rule and order, the amendments that are going to put us in a position to maintain a bipartisan bill and 

[2:21:06 PM]

hopefully get the vote that this bill deserves, again, because of all of the bipartisan work that mister Rogers has done, the committee has done, and crucially, our has staff has done. We've got a great product. Um, let's keep it great, uh, and get it passed out of the committee and off the floor. Thank you, I yield back. >> Thank you, Mr. Smith. I appreciate it. Um, I want to make just one quick comment about what you've said about incremental reform on procurement. Uh, I've been here several years and have worked on this issue of procurement and trying to do something about it. And I hope and pray that what you're doing in this bill is really going to make a big change in procurement, because we're wasting billions of dollars every year in this area. I don't want to cut defense. I want the way we spend money for defense to be spent well, and I really am 

[2:22:07 PM]

going to be watching this issue closely because I think it's it's really critical to our overall, um, national security issue. Um, that chairman Rogers, I want to we expect a robust amendment panel. So I'm going to keep my comments very brief. You've both talked about the, um, 65th consecutive year that congress has advanced the ndaa through to enactment, if we're successful, to what do you attribute this year's successful bipartisanship on your committee? >> We keep the focus on the warfighter and making sure we give them what they need to be successful and safe. And and that is our focus. It always has been. We still have our robust debates around some small measure of issues, but generally the focus is where it should be. And that's our national security. Right. 

[2:23:07 PM]

>> And you've alluded to the fact there's an array of national security threats spread across an unprecedented global landscape. Nobody can pick up a newspaper where they don't read about China or Russia, um, Iran, North Korea, uh, threatening this country. So, um, I'll come back to my concern about, um, changing the procurement system and say, um, how how are we going to quickly and efficiently calibrate our weapon systems, platforms and other assets to win on the battlefields of the future and what's embedded in the speed act that's going to help us do that? >> Yeah. The, uh, you'll you'll remember last year we made the focus of the bill, the primary focus, uh, quality of life. And this year it was the acquisition procurement process. And that's because I'm a big believer that if if nothing, if 

[2:24:07 PM]

everything's your priority, nothing's your priority. Last year, it was trying to improve the quality of life for our service members. This year we have got to get after this problem with procurement and acquisition. It is far too cumbersome and which makes it expensive and antiquated by the time it happens. So, uh, as you heard the ranking member, we went into great detail on trying to abbreviate that. And and in a nutshell, what we've done is we're trying to make the department function in a more commercial fashion. Let me give you an example. Right now, it can take years for us to put together a set of requirements that we expect vendors to try and meet. And by making them so detailed and cumbersome and broad, only the primes can participate. There are a world of midsize and small companies that cannot hit that target. We're getting away from that. One of the things that we do is instead of giving this, uh, detailed requirements, we're giving a problem saying, this 

[2:25:09 PM]

is the problem we need a solution for, and inviting the private sector to give us solutions to that problem that is going to abbreviate that dilemma of several years down to a matter of weeks. Uh, but then from that point forward, a decision has to be made on which of those solutions that are offered will be made in a matter of 90 days. And we do. We go on through the process by expediting, empowering acquisition professionals and expecting to make a difference. The way I like to characterize it is, you know, you heard the ranking member say, we have worked on this for years. We've given them all kind of authorities to go faster. They won't use them this year. We're telling them what they have to do, and we're giving them time limits to force the function of going faster. And it goes to the point that that the ranking member made, we are going to be using high tech weapon systems in the future. We have got to have the technology world involved. They will never be willing to function at this glacial pace and this 

[2:26:10 PM]

cumbersome process we've had in the past. We're trying to fix the system so it accommodates this fast moving technology. >> Can I emphasize just one point on that? The requirements process, simplifying the requirements process is the key. I remember I was visiting a shipyard where they were refurbishing a littoral combat ship, which could get us into a whole nother conversation. But, um, they were talking about and I talked to one of the workers there, and they were repainting the portion of the ship that's under the water. And he told me that there were 1200 pages of requirements for how to. And I don't doubt that it's more complicated than, I don't know, repainting your bathroom. Um, but it shouldn't have that many pages of requirements. The requirements process has become a thing in and of itself, where they just sit around and come up with requirements, which, if that's what you do, that's what you can do. But it is tied the hands of our ability to make the changes we need rapidly. It's going to be focused, as the chairman said, on outcomes. Here's what we want. Get there as quickly, as intelligently as possible. 

[2:27:10 PM]

>> And that makes sense, because by putting out all the requirements and telling people how to do it, it assumes that people in the military are doing the procurement have all the answers. That's right. When you have millions of other people out there who are working on this, maybe in a much more up to date way, able to provide a much more efficient way to do it. So I applaud you on that. Thank you very much, Mr. Mcgovern. You're recognized. >> Thank you very much. Thank you both for being here today. Um, and I'll I'll be fairly brief here. Um, uh, you both talked about how this was a bipartisan vote to get it out of committee. What was the vote? >> Uh, 56 to 2. >> That's pretty, pretty bipartisan. And but but wasn't. I'm trying to turn the clock back a year when you came here. And I think that was a bipartisan. >> Yeah, I think it was 57 or 50 8 to 1 that time. Yeah, yeah. So we lost a little ground this 

[2:28:12 PM]

year. >> So it. >> Nobody's perfect. >> Is it fair to say that, um, that if the bill is largely like it is right now, Mr. Smith, that you would vote for it on the house floor? >> Absolutely. And I suspect we would get 360, 370 votes, probably. >> And so really, the danger is whether this gets loaded up with a bunch of culture war amendments that, uh, then divide the membership. >> That is the principal risk. Yes. >> So we'll see. We'll see how, uh, how the rules process goes. Um, you know, you raise an issue that concerns me as well. And that is, um, you know, the president's domestic use of the military, which I think is a dangerous precedent. Um, and I worry about the impact that it has on military readiness to perform their core missions. But I'm also worried about, you know, what just recently happened? Uh, you know, with, uh, with the reports about the military strike on a vessel in the caribbean, um, you know, uh, 

[2:29:13 PM]

and I get it. I mean, we we all want to crack down on narco traffickers, but this strike against alleged narco traffickers sure seems like a dangerous escalation and potentially an illegal use of military force. I mean, should we be concerned about last week's military strike as as well as the president's threat to broaden the use of military force? And and I the one thing I've I've kind of come to appreciate after being here for a while, uh, and that is it's easy to get into a war. It's hard as hell to get out of one. Uh, but anyway, I know you mentioned it, I just. >> Yeah. No, I think it's worth worth focusing on this, um, to begin with, to date, we have not received any sort of detailed explanation from the white house as to who the target was, what the intelligence was behind it, why the strike was taken, the details. Now we're supposed to, on a staff level, get a brief tomorrow. We were supposed to 

[2:30:14 PM]

get that briefed last Friday. Didn't happen. We'll see if it happens tomorrow. So there's no clarity. So there's no. And there was no notification ahead of the strike, which frequently does happen certainly to the gang of eight, but to others as well. So it's very unilateral action. And then what's the justification for it. Well, typically you use the us military in one of two instances, either one, you have an authorization for the use of military force, which we've got the 2001 auf. The 2003 are enough on the books. And as strikes have happened in the Middle East, those have been used as authority. Twisted a little bit, but at least there was a legal justification for it. If you don't have any of that, all you got left is article two, which is the inherent right of self-defense, um, which is something that the courts have recognized. If you know someone's lining up to shoot a whole bunch of missiles at us ships somewhere in the world, you shouldn't have to get congressional approval before you take those missiles out before they're fired. There is no way on god's green Earth you can say that whatever was in this boat presented any sort 

[2:31:15 PM]

of imminent threat to the United States, in a military sense of the word. Yes, human trafficking and drug trafficking. They threaten us in a variety of different ways. But if you want to broaden article two to that, we can be bombing everybody, anywhere, anytime, for a thousand different reasons, which goes way beyond the true meaning of it. So it's it's it's unlawful in that regard. And then the second to your other point, are we going to use the united States military to get into a war with drug traffickers? And what are the consequences of that? Typically, we use the coast guard, the Dea, the ATF. We have a whole bunch of different the justice department, we have a whole bunch of organizations whose job it is to protect us from those things. And that delineation between them and the military is important. Once we walk into that, once the cartels know that the united States military is a direct threat to us, we got troops all over Latin America right now. They're targets. Um, how does that play out? And that's the you know, getting into a war is 

[2:32:15 PM]

easy. Getting out is hard. I love these people always say, well, you get into a war, you always have to have an exit strategy. Well, one of my favorite sayings from the military is the enemy gets a vote. You can have an exit strategy all day long, but the circumstances are going to change. Nobody has an exit strategy when they start a war because you don't know where it's going to go. That's why you need to be so careful about actually starting one. >> No, I appreciate that. And I hope that, uh, the leaders in this congress, um, rather than just kind of rally around the, the leader, um, instinctively might actually take some time to, uh, to do hearings and to and to actually make sure that we do have a policy and we don't get sucked into a needless war. Just the final thing, you know, you know, and you touched on this a little bit as well. I mean, we've seen the trump administration take unprecedented action by firing scores of senior military officers, apparently, for being perceived as disloyal to the current administration rather than, uh, for actual 

[2:33:17 PM]

performance issues. Um, representative Horsford has an amendment requiring notifications to congress, including the underlying rationale and process for making the decisions to remove a general or flag officer. Um, you know, for an administration that has touted the importance of merit in the military, uh, can you just talk a little bit about the impact of these firings, uh, and, and the impact they've had on the military? Um, and the signal it sends to the force? I mean, I want to make sure that our our generals are telling the truth, um, and not telling people what they think they want to hear. Uh, but I give you. >> I think you've you've hit upon it. I mean, there's two big things. One, you lose a lot of talent. I mean, general cq brown was prior to, you know, trump firing him, apparently for something he said 4 or 5 years ago about the experience of being a black man in the military was bipartisan, universally respected as one of the best generals we had. So we lost that talent. We lost the guy who, um, was the head of the NSA, cyber security, also incredibly talented general 

[2:34:18 PM]

across the board. You lost all of that talent to my reference point of when we, you know, gave walking papers to 75% of our cyber force. Um, you know, you're losing a lot of talent. But second is the point you just made. It has a chilling effect, you know, what is it that you're expected to do? Are you supposed to expect it to do the thing that's going to make your do your job the best, best protect America? Are you supposed to do what Donald Trump wants? I mean, it seems like a remarkably petty example, but pulling back that award from Tom Hanks yesterday, an award which, by the way, has been given to actors before Gary sinise because of the work that they did to support the military and support veterans. But since Tom Hanks had attended a Joe Biden fundraiser, you know, we're going to pull that award and undermine the authority of the group that gave it to him and make it all about trump. You got to be loyal to trump 24 over seven. You're not doing your job if you're focused on being loyal to one, shall we say, somewhat unpredictable and petty human being. Um, that's not the way the military should be structured. >> I agree, I agree with you, and I again, I thank you for 

[2:35:20 PM]

your responses. I want to thank you both again for bringing a bipartisan bill to the to the rules committee, and let's see whether it can survive, uh, the amendment process. But anyway, thank you, I yield back. >> Thank you, Mr. Mcgovern. Mr. Mr. Parker, you're recognized. >> Thank you, madam chair. And thank you both for being here. And I appreciate the fact that this is a bipartisan bill. And, um, I just have one kind of question about I don't know if you mentioned it, but the right to repair language that's in there. Um, and it is that dod only or D O W I should be calling it D O W only. Um, and is there protection for the proprietary information? >> It's still a work in progress. The senate has different language than we have, and we passed a provision in our bill with the understanding we're going to continue to work with the senate. It's limited to dod, but, uh, trying to work out the differences that we are not close to a final project product yet. >> Well, I would stick with the 

[2:36:21 PM]

house language. >> I always like the house language better. The senators have a say. >> So well, thank you on that. And I know that there was a lot of talk, uh, a lot of discussion about the, um, about the speed act. And so I just I will pass on that. But I really do appreciate that because I think it's so important that we get it, things like that. And, um, in the accountability provisions in there. But, um, really wanted to just kind of comment on, um, how it really does address the quality of life. I know you kind of said you dealt with a lot of that, uh, last time. But, you know, for the service member with the health care provisions, the pay provisions, the schooling for our service members, kids. Um, and I think the housing is really critical because you've really made some strides in that to make it more efficient and more affordable, you know, because, uh, and so some of those requirements that we're getting at, um, and really, really using our money more wisely and making it better for our service members. Um, and I know because I've seen some of 

[2:37:22 PM]

the housing and we really need to improve that for them. So with that, I'll just say thank you both. I really appreciate it. I appreciate a, um, a bipartisan bill like this. And I know that you both worked hard to make sure that happened. So thank you very much. And I yield back. >> Thank you, Mr. Fischbach. Um, Mr. Scott, you're recognized. >> Thank you, madam chair. And, um, I want to commend both of the gentlemen here today. I have the privilege of serving on that committee. It is one of the most bipartisan efforts that I've worked on. And in these national defense authorization act over the many years. And, uh, it was very bipartisan bill. Um, I did have an amendment. I'm not going to be able to get in it. So I want to take just a moment of privilege to and I've talked with you, Mr. Rogers, about this. But, you know, we we obviously know that any approaching the oil from Russia is one of the reasons that the Ukrainian war has continued to go on. And, um, I do hope that as time pushes on that we will 

[2:38:22 PM]

be able to get sanctions put on the board. Members of, uh, reliance industries, they are the largest purchaser of Russian oil and India. Uh, the ambani family controls that company. And I think that if we could put the same sanctions on, uh, the board members of reliance industries, as we have put on the Russian oligarchs, that it would come a long way towards stopping, stopping the purchases of Russian oil that's going into India and therefore hopefully stop the Ukrainian war with that. Madam chair, thank you for allowing me just a few minutes to make that statement, and I look forward to continuing to pursue those sanctions against the board members of that company that are supporting Vladimir Putin and his aggression in Ukraine. And, uh, I appreciate both of the gentlemen here and the bipartisan manner in which they have worked to make this, uh, not just our country, but, uh, those who partner with us in the pursuit of freedom and 

[2:39:23 PM]

economic opportunities, uh, more successful endeavor. >> Thank you, Mr. Scott. Mr. Griffith, you're recognized. >> Thank you very much, madam chair. When I ask each of the witnesses about amendment, um, 140 or 141, it looks like 140. Uh, that would be a Griffith amendment. Um, and it's an amendment that I have carried, I think 14 years or a copy thereof. Uh, Mr. Rosendale and I both had the same issue. We came at it different ways. The committee has indicated they prefer the Rosendale language. But just so the committee here can be reminded. And then I'll ask the two gentlemen if they have any instinctive disagreements. I understand you may not be able to answer because there's 300 and some amendments completely, but if their if their instincts are, they'd be okay with it. And it just simply says with the Rosendale language, because that's what the committee preferred over the Griffith language, that in the provisions of the, uh, prior ndas, which include, uh, 

[2:40:24 PM]

reauthorization of patriot act and, and authorization of the use of military force, that you don't detain a us citizen without some right to come to trial, uh, because in particular, the war that that they originally underlined is, has been allegedly going on now for some 20 years. And I just want to make sure that we're trying to protect American citizens and the constitutional rights of American citizens. And we did approve the house did approve it, I think the last two years. I know they did. Last year, the senate unfortunately took it out. I'm offering it again and and would hope that you all would at least be open to considering it. Gentlemen. >> I've supported it in the past. Yes, sir. You have it again. >> I think maybe both of you have. >> Uh, no, actually we haven't. Um, there's a tiny little problem with it, and that is that it changes the constitution because the constitution protects all us persons. This that you offer only protects citizens. So the first amendment, second and third, they don't say us citizens. It says. >> Next year I need to get you 

[2:41:26 PM]

the Griffith language because mine deals with center. >> No. Okay. All right. But that's that that's the one issue on it is I'm with you. But it should be all us persons, not. I can appreciate that. >> Uh, but we'll see if we can't get the the center requirement in there, because I just think that if you're going to be locked away forever, you ought to have your constitutional rights. Uh, and if you're an American citizen on American soil or even an American person, they ought to at least establish that you had knowledge that you were assisting a terrorist organization as opposed to just somehow you inadvertently assisted a terrorist organization. And I'm happy to switch the amendments out if you all can reach an agreement in the hallway. But I'm just trying to make the committee happy. I yield back, madam chair. >> Thank you, Mr. Griffith. Mr. Roy, you're recognized. >> Thank you. Chairman. I thank the gentleman for, um, coming up here and testifying and for the work on the bill. Um, I just want to clarify that that I'm correct that we are, um, in the ndaa, that we are authorizing levels that are keeping spending flat, uh, at 

[2:42:26 PM]

current level spending, um, and that that's reflective of the work that was done, um, on the reconciliation package, that there were some money in there for defense, uh, and reflective of the overall agreement to try to keep, keep spending, um, at that at that level. Um, but I just wanted to confirm that that's the case. My understanding of the bill is that is that right? That's correct. Chairman. Okay. >> With the. One. >> Yeah, sure. >> Caveat, please. 150, I think 100 and ultimately wound up being 156 billion was added through the reconciliation. >> Yeah. No, I know that's what I was noting. Is that inconsistent with what we had done previously with the reconciliation package. Um, and uh, and that that was important, that was a part of the overall effort, um, to ensure defense, um, is where it needs to be. And then the second thing I would note is just a point that it is. I know there's still some deliberations going on, but with respect to amendments and whether they're going to be, um, tied to has jurisdiction versus something broader, um, 

[2:43:27 PM]

and if it's sticking has jurisdiction and that's consistent, then then then I'll accept that. Uh, but then I do feel strongly for getting beyond that, that, uh, the language that I've had now for a while on, uh, terminating the amps that have been lingering for far too long, um, that, uh, that we need to address those issues. But but obviously, if we're sticking to a rule that's consistent. >> We're not sticking to that consistent rule. And I'm with you, I think your amendment should be included. And personally, I think if we have issues that are agreed in the committees of jurisdiction are agreed, I think we should use the ndaa vehicle to pass what we can pass as a legislative body. And and also we make exceptions to that. Just to to fuel your argument a little bit in this rule already is the amendment on cryptocurrency, which has nothing to do with our jurisdiction, which has been included. So the rule gets violated when leadership wants to violate the rule. And I think they ought to be inclusive of all of us. If we can get something done through this process, we should we should get it done. Now, you 

[2:44:28 PM]

can't override the committee of jurisdiction, but working with them, I think it ought to be included. >> Well, we'll see how the debate goes through the day on that. But I did want to make sure, just for the record, that it's clear. I think there are significant bipartisan agreement that, look, we can agree on the need to have clarity on the authorizations of the use of military force. And there's bipartisan agreement and the need for the authorization to use military force where it's appropriate around the globe. But we do not need to be operating under 23 year old authorizations of force. So, uh, I'd certainly like to be able to address that issue if, if we're and as long as it's consistent with rules that we're going to apply how we operate. And we'll have those conversations today. And I appreciate the gentleman, I yield back. >> Thank you very much. Um, gentlemen. Um, there's no one else to ask any questions. So we appreciate very much your coming, your being so succinct and so direct, uh, with your comments and with your, uh, answers to the questions. And, um, you're excused. Uh, I'd like to call Mr. Wilson. Mr. 

[2:45:32 PM]

Fine and Mr. Ander to the table. Um. I think, Mr. Wilson, uh, you were you came in first, and so I would, um, like to recognize you. I, um, make the same statement that I always make your. Any written comments that you have will be included in the record, and we'll ask that you keep your statements short and to the point, and I recognize you, Mr. Wilson. >> Thank you very much. >> And colleagues, and indeed, I'm grateful for the leadership of chairman Mike Rogers and ranking member Adam Smith. The 

[2:46:32 PM]

bipartisanship we've seen, and I appreciate the opportunity to testify in support of amendment number five, 35, to repeal the Caesar act, to support president trump and special envoy to Syria, ambassador Tom barrack, who is here in Washington today. I'm also grateful to have ambassador barrack support for the amendment. The Caesar law undermines the president's policy and makes it almost impossible to, quote, give Syria a chance. As proposed by president trump, the Caesar act was passed in 2019, and the ndaa was intended to protect civilians from the brutal ba'athist socialist dictatorship of bashar Al Assad, and its was imposed only years into Assad's war crimes, where nearly half a million people were killed. Additionally, the Caesar act has succeeded. By the time Assad's regime collapsed last December, the Assad resources were depleted and soldiers were only earning $17.50 a month and refusing to 

[2:47:34 PM]

fight. I was closely involved in efforts to extend the act as it approached expiration last year, and I'm grateful with so much leadership here that it did pass the house in February of last year, and we worked to extend the Caesar act in the ndaa conference committee. The result is the Assad dictatorship abdicated on December the 8th and fled to Moscow two weeks ago today. I was humbled to accompany ambassador barrack and senator Jeanne Shaheen, bipartisan, bicameral, to encourage the new government, which wants to work with the west. As we stood actually in Assad's former office. Since then, the president trump has taken many historic steps to lift sanctions on Syria, meeting with president al-shara in Riyadh and issuing executive orders, giving him new and expanded authorities to sanction malign actors in Syria, keeping sanctions on war 

[2:48:35 PM]

criminals. Additionally, president trump is working with Saudi Arabia and nato ally Turkey while negotiating with Israel for stability. The problem is the Caesar act. Sanctions remain mandatory, with only temporary waivers, as the treasury officials have said. This discourages investments creating jobs. The result is a climate of risk aversion, handicapping recovery. Ambassador Tom barrack supports full repeal to promote a sovereign Syria. The law was meant for specific ends to protect civilians from Assad, Russia and Iran, and dismantling the chemical weapons and holding war criminals accountable. These conditions are no longer applicable. The law has served its purpose and should be repealed to give Syria a chance with support of amendment number 535, I respectfully yield back my time. >> Thank you very much, Mr. Wilson. Mr. Fine, you're 

[2:49:36 PM]

recognized. >> Thank you, madam chair. >> It's an honor. >> To be here for the first time. Before all of you. I will try to be brief. Uh, I'm sure there's many things you'd like to do other than listen to me talk. So I'm here to speak about amendment 779, which deals with PTSD. The department of veterans affairs believes that 29% of veterans who serve in operation Iraqi freedom and operation enduring freedom have PTSD, which causes all sorts of problems at home as families struggle to help their loved ones adjust to normal life. A better understanding of the disorder, as well as how to deal with it, can help us better recognize, diagnose, and treat those suffering from PTSD. No other country in the world is dealing with as much PTSD other than us as Israel is, which has been fighting a terrible war for the past two years on seven fronts. And we even saw signs of that today. Um, because so much of their population is involved in war fighting, several leading Israeli hospitals, universities and nonprofits have actually dedicated their efforts to researching and treating PTSD. 

[2:50:36 PM]

What my amendment would do is authorize the secretary of defense to establish a grant which would be awarded to us academic institutions or nonprofits who conduct joint research on PTSD with their Israeli counterparts. The amendment does not appropriate any money for the grant it lays. The framework for the grant money would have to be requested by the dod and appropriated in next year's defense appropriations for the grant to be funded. Um, this has been included in the ndaa the last two years, so hopefully the third time is the charm. And with that, I'll yield back the balance of my time. >> Thank you very much, Mr. Ander. You're recognized. >> Thank you, madam chair. Ranking member. Uh, I'm here to speak on amendment 1146. It was recently brought to my attention that the fiscal year 26 national defense authorization bill includes language in section 1110 that would prevent the department of defense from implementing president trump's executive order 14. 251 this executive 

[2:51:40 PM]

order ensures that certain agencies can deliver on their missions without being hamstrung by negotiations with labor bosses. This is especially important for the department of defense, whose work is directly related to national security. That is why I'm offering amendment 1146 to preserve the department of defense's ability to implement the president's eo staffing policies that the department of defense should be determined by elected officials who have sworn an oath to defend the constitution. Instead, federal agency operations are often held hostage by union bosses, whose number one priority is not our national defense. Under the Biden administration, union bosses representing federal workers used their leverage to promote policies that increase inefficiency. They made it difficult to fire problematic workers and prolonged work from home policies. Despite what was in the best interest of the American people. President trump is delivering on his promise to improve how federal agencies operate so they can 

[2:52:40 PM]

truly serve the common good. But section 1110 of the ndaa directly attacks president trump's government efficiency and national security agenda. I urge the committee to repeal this section and to oppose future riders, and must pass legislation that would undermine the president's agenda. Thank you, I yield back. >> Thank you. Mr. Ander, um, I thank all of you for coming today. And, um, I have no questions. Mr. Mcgovern. >> Uh, yeah. Thank you for being here. I just ensuring the right amendment testimony from Robert. >> Mullins, support of his amendments. Number 716 722 726 893 8958 96, 898 and 934. And I want unanimous consent to adjourn the record amendment testimony from Shelton in support of her amendments 955 and 956. >> Without objection, so ordered. Thank you, Mr. Mcgovern. Mr. Spock. 

[2:53:41 PM]

>> Thank you very much, madam chair. And I just want to say thank you all for being here. And Mr. Fine, you're welcome back. Any time you were, you were short and to the point. And I appreciate that. And I thank the members. >> Be careful what you wish for. >> Well, you know, you could screw it up next time if you go on too long. So. But thank you all for being here. >> Uh, Mr. Scott. Mr. Griffith. No. Gentlemen, you're, um, you did a wonderful job. Obviously, you answered the questions from all the members of the committee. So we thank you very much. And you're excused. >> Thank you, madam. Thank you, madam chair. >> This is. Is there anyone else seeking to testify on hr 3838? Seeing none. This closes the hearing portion of our meeting. Without objection, the committee stands in recess. Uh, 

[2:54:41 PM]

subject to the call of the chair, and we will be in touch with, um, staff and members on reconvening. >> Hoping that we can do some votes. Yeah.

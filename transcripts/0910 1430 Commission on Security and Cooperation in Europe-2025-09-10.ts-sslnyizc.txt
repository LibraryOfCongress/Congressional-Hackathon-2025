[2:35:31 PM]

>> Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to welcome everyone to a open hearing on behalf of the commission, organization for security and co-operation in Europe. Uh, it's a great honor for myself to be a co-chair. Our chairman, senator Roger wicker. Uh, the senate is in session. And, uh, as conflicting, uh, we, uh, have this, these issues. But the bottom line, uh, we're really grateful to be here and to have such distinguished witnesses. And, it's so important, uh, for the caucuses, uh, ultimately for central Asia, uh, over and over again, their importance to the republic of Georgia just can't be underestimated. Uh, first of all, the people in the, uh, people being victimized by, uh, what's going, uh, the current government and, uh, I'm just so grateful for the leadership, particularly of, uh, Billy, uh, and, uh, just over and over. Everybody here can 

[2:36:32 PM]

make a difference. And it's so bipartisan, and I'm just so grateful. And with this, we'll begin with opening statements, and then we'll go to the testimony. And, uh, and so, ladies and gentlemen, the Georgian dream government, through rigged elections in Georgia, is dragging the people of the republic of Georgia into dictatorship, stripping away their sovereignty and condemning them to poverty. It's betraying the country's traditional allies, including the United States, which so appreciates our joint service together militarily around the world. And the Georgian troops were, uh, un were just so, um, positive, without caveats, uh, to defend themselves and defend American troops and defend western interests for freedom and democracy. It's betraying to our allies. And this is undermining the good faith support from the United States, which for decades has invested heavily to help the republic of Georgia build a free, prosperous and democratic state 

[2:37:32 PM]

for its dynamic citizens. What we're witnessing today is the dismantling of that progress by a corrupt regime that has no legitimacy. Georgian dream came to power through fraudulent elections. It rules as a one party state. It has arrested opposition leaders, beaten and tortured peaceful protesters, silenced, intimidated independent media and turn Georgia into a laboratory of authoritarian control. And it's quickly putting itself in the category of Belarus and the Russian Federation. This betrayal does not stop there. Georgian dream has chosen to cozy up to the Chinese communist party, opening the door for Chinese influence in the Georgian economy and infrastructure. And very important, sadly giving its black sea port to the Chinese communist party, blocking American businesses from strategic trade routes and trying the Georgian time the Georgian future to a regime that openly prepares for 

[2:38:34 PM]

confrontation with the American people. At the same time, it's working hand in glove with war criminal Putin, helping Moscow evade sanctions and resell its oil, even as Russia still illegally occupies 20% of Georgia's territory, with south ossetia and abkhazia. Let's be clear Georgian dream does not represent the Georgian people. Time and again, the Georgian people have shown through massive demonstrations in their own voices. They want democracy, sovereignty and return to a future with the west of peace and prosperity. But today, their aspirations are being crushed by a small group of oligarchs and autocrats who answer not to the people, but to the Chinese communist party in beijing and war criminal Putin in Moscow, and also spending time with the dictatorship, the regime in Tehran. This hearing will discuss how far Georgia has 

[2:39:35 PM]

fallen under Georgian dream, and what that means for America's security and interests. We will also discuss what tools the United States has to push back, including the bipartisan mega act to hold Georgian dream accountable while standing firmly with the people of Georgia. The house of representatives has stood with the people of Georgia with a remarkable vote of 349 to 42. 90% of the members of the us house of representatives, Democrats and Republicans 90%. I don't think we can find another bill like this. Okay, but 90% voted yes. And that is for mega boring for fair and free elections. I'm grateful to our witnesses. Indeed, president salom Nashville. Additionally, former defense minister key dash. L and different in a very easy name. Okay, here we go. Luke. Coffee? Okay. Uh, no. No no. Hey. No no no no. Hey, hey. He's here because he's with the Hudson 

[2:40:36 PM]

institute, which makes a difference. Uh, in providing assistance to, um, to members of congress. And I want to thank you. You had the Bulgarian, the minister of energy from Bulgaria visit your office yesterday. Uh, what a difference. Uh, the Hudson institute makes, uh, in promoting, uh, free markets and limited government, uh, the people who are here today understand, uh, better than anyone. What is at stake? The Georgian people have marched, bled and even died for freedom. And there were recent arrests within the last 24 hours and attacks, they have fought alongside Americans in Afghanistan, uh, across the world. They have proven their friendship with us now, as Georgian dream sells them out to Russia and China, it's our duty to prove our friendship. In return, we must not stand by. As the republic of Georgia is stolen from its people. With that, I now yield to the ranking member of the commission, the honorable congressman Steve Cohen of the republic of Tennessee. 

[2:41:37 PM]

>> Thank you, Mr. Chair, and thank all of you all for attending and having an interest in the members on the committee here. I was in Georgia. I think it was 2015. Was that the year of the dream? And when I went there to look at the elections and be a witness to the elections, um, I was really impressed by the people in the streets and their enthusiasm for opportunity to vote for democracy and for a new government. Um, I saw in the hotel I was in, um, Mr. Ivanishvili, and I hate to say that judge people sometimes by how they look, but when I first saw him, he had all the appearances. Little did I know that, because I didn't know much about Elon Musk at the time. But he had all these things that later. I've seen Elon Musk feeling rich, arrogant, uh, elitist and, uh, very well thought of himself. And I thought, this is the good 

[2:42:38 PM]

guy. But he swept in and I saw him there. And that Georgia dream was turned into the to the Georgia nightmare, because it has not been what it was in professed to be. Uh, they've had all kind of problems. And Mr. Wilson's explained them well, um, dissent has been discouraged. Surveillance and intimidation of citizens has been regular, and violence against peaceful protesters has been common. I see in the television all these tens of thousands of people in the streets protesting on a regular basis, and it makes you realize how much democracy is important. And it's important in America, too. And sometimes we don't seem to appreciate it or realize it. And but they seem to show that in Georgia. And of course, we saw Russia. I think it was just a little bit before that, when Russia went in and took part of Georgia. And, uh, they'll do it again if they can. Now they've got an ally there and Mr. Ivanishvili. So it's an easier way to take over from within than from without. Um. 

[2:43:40 PM]

It's unfortunate that the senate didn't pass the. It's not it looks like they're not going to pass the mega law. And there were some problems over there and made it might have related to one particular business that's building a port and some issues. I'm not sure what it is, but while Mr. Wilson's right, there's such a great majority of Democrats and Republicans in a bipartisan fashion supporting the bill, and it's almost unheard of, there's great support that over there. One person was able to apparently kill it. And, uh, that's news to me. It's amazing that that's happened and why it's happened. I do not understand it. Um, but I'm impressed by the Georgia people and what they've done, and I will continue to support them in their quest for democratic values and a democratic state. Uh, those are universal values, and we should be obligated and are obligated to defend them. Uh, so I support the people of Georgia. Uh, we must hold those people responsible for repression. And we must support independent voices and civil society and stated clearly and 

[2:44:41 PM]

unequivocally on the side of those fighting for democracy. Thank you very much. 
>> Thank you, ranking member Steve Cohen. If there are any other members we're really grateful to have, uh, congressman from Texas here with us. And we also doctor Greg Murphy and from north Carolina. And then we have, uh, congressman Jake Ellzey, uh, another Texan. So Texas is well represented today. 
>> We're outnumbering. 
>> Everybody but you in so many different ways. All right. But, um. 
>> But we're not going to redistrict. 
>> And so. 
>> And as, as it congressman Cohen just said, no more politics here. Okay. Just so with that in mind, and again, this is such an important time in the history of the republic of Georgia. And so we're so grateful to have the fifth president of the republic of Georgia, Salome zurabishvili. And, uh, and, uh, each one of our witnesses will have five minutes and, uh, and then, uh, try to stay within that so that 

[2:45:41 PM]

we can then have questions from the panel, who is here today? Thank you. 
>> A government that represents them. And I think it's important that their voice comes to you, comes to Washington. And thank you very much for this opportunity. Um, you have described the situation, uh, that we have currently in Georgia. I have to recall that 100 years ago, uh, the commission of the congress was already holding a hearing about the situation in Georgia. That was 1926, and the situation was extremely dire in 

[2:46:44 PM]

Georgia at that time. I hope that the parallel stops there, uh, and that we can see things evolving in a different manner. And I want to talk not to describe the situation in Georgia. We all know. And it has been at length. Uh explicited in the media also, that the situation is extremely difficult in terms of all the democratic rights, freedoms, uh, and the human condition. And I'm also here representing the people that are today sitting in jail. And maybe symbolically, I want to mention as a journalist, a woman that is sitting in jail for absolutely no reason. So for all these people, I'm here to talk about the relations between Georgia and the United States, to recall that for more than 30 years, the United States has 

[2:47:44 PM]

stood shoulder to shoulder with with Georgia and has been there to help us build an independent, stable, pro-western, reform oriented state, uh, which we're losing right now. Uh, it has invested a lot of resources in Georgia, financial resources, but also human resources. And that was not just a gift. It was a commitment to Georgia's freedom, to Georgia's security and European future. It has contributed to the development of Georgia's economy of democratic institutions, helped equip and train Georgia's defense forces, build schools and hospitals, and trained teachers, civil servants and medical professionals. Those actions secured peace and stability in Georgia, a country that became increasingly decisive for black sea security, for the middle corridor, for the energy routes linking the 

[2:48:45 PM]

black and caspian seas and beyond to central Asia and its vast resources. And of course, it was also acting. Georgia was acting as a reliable partner of the United States, joining the missions in Afghanistan and Iraq. And and that is the most important. The Georgian people massively supported this partnership. So, in short, Georgia was a strategic win for the us, a win over Russia and a peaceful one after more than a century of Russia attempting to keep the caucasus and central Asia under its exclusive domination, America had become a full fledged actor in the region that inspired our people and defined new standards. Today, for the first time in more than three decades, the ruling regime in Georgia has turned its back to this partnership. Distancing and 

[2:49:47 PM]

isolating both itself and the country from its trusted ally while increasingly aligning itself with the United States adversaries. Russia is playing its hand to recover its dominant position. Georgian dream has grown increasingly anti-western and pro-Russian. Gdi's public positions have increasingly taken an aggressively anti-american tone. Public attacks on the us representatives. I think that the ambassador is sitting behind me will not disagree with that on us policies accusing us of pushing for the opening of a second front against Moscow, hostile attacks on president trump personally and on his administration. In parallel, gd leaders have been actively deepening ties, first and foremost with Russia. Of course, copying copycatting the rhetoric of the Russian leaders 

[2:50:48 PM]

with China anaklia strategic partnership. Following the suspension of the strategic partnership with the united States. Visa free with China and Iran, 380 degrees turn from the former foreign and internal policy, compromising the Independence of the country. That was achieved at a very high cost, because we still have 20% of our territory that is occupied. And the war that Russia started against Georgia in 2008, after, uh, two other aggressions against Georgia in the same century, a direction directly opposite to us national interest, Russian new hybrid war against Georgia's Independence. Uh, Georgia has Russia has intensified its interference policies in Georgia to undermine democracy, instill societal division not 

[2:51:49 PM]

with armed forces this time, but with new hybrid techniques. For the first time in recent history, Russia is mastering soft power propaganda allied to modern technology and to the use of the leaders that are in place. These Kremlin style methods are from one and only handbook that has been tested already in Russia in the past decade. Total control and consolidation of power, seizure of government institutions, violation of fundamental human rights. Ignoring the constitution. Politicizing the courts and the police forces. A position has been abolished. Practically, civil activists are jailed. Nongovernmental organizations are deprived of funding, and paralyzed political parties are facing threats of very directly of being, uh, eradicated. Russia 

[2:52:50 PM]

is clearly playing a strategic card in Georgia to recoup its domination of the east west route, its control over the caucasus. Russia has known forever that Georgia was central to controlling the caucasus and the black sea, thus reversing the strategic win of the western partner. In the past 30 years, since Independence and testing a new strategy, a new hybrid strategy that can be implemented then in other countries, and not only in the countries that are sharing borders with Russia. Uh, let there be no doubt the people of Georgia are not accepting this subversive capture of the state. They remain fully committed to democracy and to restoring the strategic partnership with the us, as well as to their European future. That is the meaning of 368 days of uninterrupted protest against 

[2:53:51 PM]

the pro-Russian policies. And that is the meaning of the resilience of the civil society. Why should Georgia matters for the us? Without democracy in Georgia, there is no stability and we risk entering a period of instability. And without stability in Georgia, there is no peace in the south caucasus. Georgia's future constitutes a strategic challenge for the United States, as well as for the European partners Russia recognized in the past centuries that who controls plc controls the caucasus. It is time that our western partners recognize the strategic reality and prevent that the black sea and the increased Chinese and Russian influence escapes the western powers, that Georgia's increasing economic and political ties with Russia and China isolates the country, prevents that Georgia's ruling regime, courting Iran and 

[2:54:53 PM]

terrorist leader, reunites with those forces and prevents that. Georgia becomes a gray zone where all forms of sanctions circumvention, but not only of trafficking of migrant routes, would be flourishing. And the us has to and our western partners have to consolidate the geopolitical shift in the region. The us brokered agreement between Armenia and Azerbaijan has opened new avenues for regional stability, connectivity and economic cooperation. It has been a big win for and a success personally of president trump. But this geopolitical shift should not be allowed to wither away. If Russia were allowed to expand its influence over Georgia, thus blocking the potential of a united and peaceful caucasus. Bridging blacks and caspian seas, eu and central Asia connectivity. Diversification of energy 

[2:55:53 PM]

routes are major opportunities for the us and the European partners, but all depend on preventing Russia from recovering its exclusive domination over its southern flank. In conclusion, complacency with Russia is dangerous. A conciliatory approach by the us towards Georgia's de facto leadership has failed in the past and will not succeed now. There is no time for ambiguity. There is a need of a clear policy towards Georgia stating us interests. What ruling regime in Georgia is doing is not just a betrayal of Georgia's people's will and its democratic values. It is a direct no to the strategic partnership with the united States, American taxpayers, diplomats and servicemen have invested heavily in Georgia's success. To watch that investment being wasted through actions that contradict the us 

[2:56:54 PM]

security interests and hostile rhetoric should be unacceptable and stated as such, accountability, finally, is essential. There must be real consequences for those that think that being in power means that they can do anything they want. Um, stifle dissent, jeopardize the country's future. The Georgian people deserve better, and so do their friends. The American people who support has always been rooted in the hope of a free, stable and democratic Georgia. Thank you very much. 
>> Thank you very much, madam president. And now we proceed to the former minister of defense who's been so successful, uh tinatin. Dusha Lee. And we're so grateful to have you here. 
>> Thank you very much. Thank you for having me here and having this discussion also. Thank you very much for the support Georgian people always had from the United States, from the congress, from the house of representatives, as well as the senate. Um, I'm 

[2:57:55 PM]

here today to try at least to represent the majority opinion of Georgian people, Georgian people who've been fighting for partnerships, standing together with the United States over the years, over three thousands of years, and, um, building a viable democratic state. I'm here to defend Georgia's single most important foreign policy priority, maintaining and strengthening our strategic partnership with the united States. It is very important for us to expose the authoritarian drift and present alarming evidence that the Georgian dream government has systematically and rapidly abandoned these national interests of a country, turning instead towards alliances with the authoritarian powers. And finally, I will try to show why Georgia matters to America. But I'm president already identified some of the points. I will try to echo them and add some more additional argument. The concrete evidence I bring here today speaks not just 

[2:58:56 PM]

about Georgian government's departure from the strategic partnership with the us, but speaks first and foremost about their departure from the will and strategic interests of the Georgian people. This is departure from the course that led Georgian hero Georgian to sacrifice his life while being tortured by Russians in 2008. This is departure from the course, which led journalist Georgian journalists to sacrifice her freedom just a couple of months back, while protecting the cause of Andrew Clyde from the increasing anti-western and pro-Russian government of Georgia. I speak here as a former minister of defense, and I'm of a country that proudly fought shoulder to shoulder with the American army in Iraq, Afghanistan and beyond. Georgia was the largest non-nato, the second largest contributor of troops in Afghanistan. We paid a heavy price with the highest casualty rate and 435 wounded servicemen. 

[2:59:57 PM]

Um, let me begin with a simple truth. Truth? There is no security of Georgia without the partnership with the united States. It never was, and there is no viable option for it to ever exist without the united States assistance and commitment, Georgia's statehood would not have been secured and would not have survived. It was us involvement in 2008 that stopped Putin in Georgia during the August war. Us leadership has been and remains central to the non-recognition policy of our breakaway territories occupied by Russia. It was us assistance that helped us build the modern army and state institutions. It was the us assistance that helped us build hospitals, schools, develop university programs. List is very long and we hope this partnership can be saved and will stay there. Georgia matters for the United States, Europe and international community for three fundamental reasons. First, its geography. 

[3:00:59 PM]

Second, its strategic connectivity, and third, its democratic example. Georgia lies at the very heart of middle corridor, the modern silk road route linking east and west, north and south, bypassing Russia and Iran. We may be small in size, but our competitive advantage has been our role as a gateway and connector within central Asia and European markets through pipelines, railways and ports. This is not only the trade route, it is what I call the corridor of freedom corridor. We are goods, energy, data. People fly without interference, without political blackmail. That is so much present on the northern route and in the south of Georgia. Unlike its northern alternative, it is the road where there is no political blackmail. It is both practical and politically reliable for the United States and its allies. For the United States, the middle corridor offers offer is invaluable resilience 

[3:01:59 PM]

in the face of authoritarian strongholds. Given the fundamentalist threats from Iran, authoritarian Russia seeking to weaponize its geography, and China cementing, um, obviously the middle corridor provides democratic alternative to all of that. Georgia is its anchor. Without Georgia, there is no free corridor. Lose it, and door opens to Russia, Iran and China. Here is the report I distributed at this hearing about the Iran's, uh, ambitions in Georgia, modern ambitions in Georgia, about the ways Georgian dream tries to avoid sanctions set on the Iran, how Iranians see Georgia as a haven for their economic activities. Um, using Georgian territory, using companies, establishing Georgia. I will not go in details of it, but here is an evidence based proof of all those problems. Uh, the Georgian dream represents, uh, 

[3:03:00 PM]

in today's world from this very particular point of view, a free, democratic, western oriented Georgia is an unacceptable to Moscow, Tehran, and increasingly problematic for beijing. And unfortunately, today's ruling party, Georgian dream has chosen a path that serves those authoritarian interests. Rather than resisting them, they undermine the institutions, manipulated elections, criminalized dissidents, arrested opposition leaders, used violence against peaceful protests, and refused to protect the will of the Georgian people expressed at the ballot box. Georgian dream has deepened ties with authoritarian powers. They caught Chinese companies while blocking us businesses from opportunities in the middle corridor. Georgian dream has created a textbook level case of anaklia seaport, where the American Georgian consortium was kicked out and, uh, the promise was made for the Chinese company to come. Unfortunately, it has not happened yet, but there is a 

[3:04:01 PM]

very strong interest on the Georgian dream side to pave the way to the Chinese company. And here you can see, uh, lots of all these reports are about the Chinese involvement in Georgia, are about the Chinese, uh, kleptocratic deals with the Chinese companies made by the Georgian government. Very important point. Not to be mistaken. China is not investing in Georgia. There are no Chinese investments in Georgia. Instead, they win procurement bids one after another under the favorable conditions and reap benefits from Georgia. Here we've been investigating, researching, writing about those dirty deals over the years. Company after another. And while united States have invested billions in Georgian economy and provided over $4 billion in aid for the Georgian state institutions, the Chinese exploiting the corrupt and kleptocratic nature of the Georgian government, is gaining more and more. They secured 

[3:05:01 PM]

over 4.5 billion, and this represents only a small portion of contracts they have received that Mr. At this point, again, so as not to be misled, there is no significant fdi coming from China to Georgia. It is all your money, international financial institutions money, American money, European union taxpayers money, Georgian taxpayers money. This is the chart of the fdi to Georgia. And you can see, uh, it starts with United Kingdom, all countries across. And China comes very handy, very at the very end of it. And even more for the demonstration, I have made another chart comparing small country Malta, uh, to big country China in terms of fdi to Georgia. And on this chart, you can see that it's not only United States, European union, uk or other big players, but even a country like Malta is dominating over Chinese investments to Georgia. And I think this speaks volumes about their actual interests and 

[3:06:03 PM]

involvement. And finally, this is the chart of the ten, uh, largest foreign direct countries with the largest foreign direct investments in Georgia. Uh, over the course of last ten years. There is no China. There is no China among the first top ten investors in Georgia. Uh, but again, as it was said, they win all the contracts. They benefit from all the money that is coming as aid or through the financial institutions to Georgia. And, um, using those kleptocratic networks of the Georgian government with the Chinese, uh, implementing those projects, the consequences are grave. Georgia's drifting into authoritarianism, and it does not threaten only its own people, but we believe it directly undermines us interests in the region. It weakens the reliability of the middle corridor. It weakens the security of the transit routes that flies through Georgia. It reduces us influence in the black sea and eurasia at a time when Russia and China are 

[3:07:04 PM]

fighting for expanding theirs, and it emboldens authoritarian regimes by providing that western allies can be pulled away and democratic experiments reversed. This is not simply Georgia's internal problem. It is a strategic setback for the entire transatlantic community. Our competitive advantage never was oil and gas. It was a democratic Georgia European free, ready to stand side by side with the United States and European allies. It has threatened Moscow's imperial projects and ambitions. If Georgia can succeed, then Russians may ask, why not us? If Georgians can live under the rule of law, then Belarusians will wonder why not us? Georgia's transformation was infectious, starting from the rose revolution all across the board. Uh, it was dominating the debate. And Russia and for Russia, China, Iran and every other authoritarian power. This was deeply alarming and dangerous. And that is 

[3:08:04 PM]

precisely why Russia and now, increasingly, China, have a vested interest in undermining our sovereignty, corrupting our institutions and dragging us back into the orbit of authoritarianism. But, uh, for the conclusion, I should say that there are good news. Georgian people have not given up. Despite the repression, propaganda, ruling parties betrayal of our democratic aspirations. Georgia's remain overwhelmingly pro-western, poll after poll. It shows support for European union and nato membership at highest heights. The people continue to believe in freedom, and they continue to believe in the United States. This distinction matters because when we speak of Georgia today, we must not confuse the government with the nation. Georgians continue to wave American and eu flags at protests. They continue to demand Georgia belong to Europe and to the democratic world. Georgia has always relied on us support, and in these difficult times, we need it more than ever. We need you to stand by 

[3:09:05 PM]

us while we talk to our friends or our enemies. At the heart of these conversations are the questions of eu membership, nato membership, and realities of Russian occupation. We fight every day and we need all the support we can get. Sanctions, diplomatic measures targeting political elite of the Georgian dream, enablers of the regime, Russian style propaganda machinery and the ideologists of Putin driven policy. This brings me to the role the United States can play, uh, with very concrete issues. First, targeted accountability, sanctions and Visa bans should be directed at the ruling elite. Their families, their enablers. Punish those who betray Georgia. More sanctions for good leadership, more scholarships for Georgian youth and students, two support for democratic institutions and civil society. Assist independent media, civil society organizations. Grassroots movements. These are the lifelines of democracy in Georgia today. Three stand explicitly with the Georgian 

[3:10:05 PM]

people. Make clear that us support is for democracy, sovereignty and Independence, not for the ruling party. Undermining, uh, the most important values of the Georgian state for support bipartisan legislation that represents exactly the kind of sustained strategic support that can help Georgian civil society, independent media and reformers to survive targeted sanctions against those who undermine democracy and tirelessly make friends with axis of evil, evil enemies of the us and democratic transatlantic partners are equally vital. It sends the strongest possible signal that Georgia's democratic future remains a us strategic priority. It provides tools to hold accountable those who undermine democracy while strengthening the capacity of civil society. Invest in the middle corridor and connectivity. Georgia's strategic geography must not be left to Chinese, Russian or 

[3:11:05 PM]

Iranian influence. Six the deepen security cooperation Georgia has shown through its contribution in Afghanistan and Iraq, that it is a reliable security partner. Renewed defense cooperation, joint trainings, strong deterrence measures in the black sea are not gifts. They are mutually beneficial investments and finally maintain people to people ties, scholarships, exchanges, cultural programs. These are very important. Georgian story is not finished. We have stumbled but we have not fallen. Georgian people remain committed to the values that made us partners of the United States in the first place. We are at a moment of profound danger. Yet it if left to drift, Georgia may indeed slide deeper into authoritarianism and away from the west. But with us support, steadfast, bipartisan, principled Georgia can reclaim its role as a beacon of democracy, stability and business opportunity in the black sea. Thank you very much 

[3:12:06 PM]

and looking forward for your questions. 
>> And thank you very much. Uh, former minister of defense for the republic of Georgia. And we now proceed to Luke coffee. Luke is a senior fellow with the Hudson institute, but also he has a background of being a very, uh, highly respected member of the army of the United Kingdom, having served in Italy, uh, southern command and also in Afghanistan. Mr. Coffee. 
>> Thank you. Uh, Mr. Chairman and ranking member Cohen and distinguished commissioners, I'm honored to speak before this commission today. The views I express in this testimony are my own and should not be construed as representing any official position of Hudson institute. Democratic backsliding. Any in any partner country is troubling, but in Georgia, the consequences are serious because it undermines us national security. In recent years, as you've heard today, the Georgian dream has embraced a Kremlin aligned worldview. It has claimed that nato enlargement was responsible for 

[3:13:06 PM]

its Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It claimed it has criticized western sanctions, while at the same time increasing trade with Moscow. And this has made Georgia an economic gray zone through which sanctions are circumvented. It has also made it difficult for volunteers from Georgia to go to to Ukraine and fight, and those that do are often harassed when they get home. But, Mr. Chairman, there's also the issue of Tbilisi's cozy relationship with Iran. In July, the Georgian deputy foreign minister actually went to the Iranian embassy to sign a condolence book honoring those killed during American and Israeli airstrikes. Earlier this year, a Georgian national was convicted in a us federal court for his role in an assassination plot directed by the irgc against an Iranian American journalist. In a separate case, another Georgian national was arrested in neighboring Azerbaijan after being recruited by the quds 

[3:14:07 PM]

force to help carry out an attempted assassination of a jewish leader. Open source evidence suggests that the ama international university, sanctioned by the us treasury for its ties to the irgc, operates two at two different locations inside Georgia. These examples show how the Georgian dream's willingness to get closer with the islamic republic has created space for its intelligence services and proxies to operate more freely in the country. Georgia's deepening ties with beijing are also concerning you. As you've just heard from my fellow, uh, witness, uh, the prime minister described China as one of the best examples of state modernization, suggesting that it offers a positive model for other global powers at a time when many European countries are pushing out Chinese investments, Georgia is moving in the opposite direction. For example, after a us Georgian consortium was blocked to leave the anaklia deepwater port project in 2020, and now seems 

[3:15:09 PM]

we're on the verge of a us sanctioned Chinese company running this project. This could hinder the trump administration's efforts to access rare Earth minerals in places like central Asia. In the telecommunications sector, the trend is equally concerning. An estimated 70 to 80% of Georgia's government institutions use surveillance cameras made by Chinese firms, while huawei is embedded throughout Georgia's telecom networks. Now, as a small country on the eurasian landmass, it is natural for Georgia to want to seek cordial relations with beijing. But what is alarming is the amount of enthusiasm at which Georgian dream officials show as they pursue their closer relationship with China. Now, this geopolitical assessment assessment leads to three questions why, as Russian influence wanes across much of the post-soviet space, is Moscow now more influential in Georgia? How is it that the islamic republic of Iran is 

[3:16:09 PM]

able, or even allowed to operate so effectively in Georgia? Why? While Europe pushes out Chinese involvement, does Georgia appear to welcome beijing? Now, some Georgian dream officials see themselves as aligned with president trump. In fact, the opposite is true. Cozying up to Iran is not in line with president trump's worldview. Inviting the ccp into your critical infrastructure is not consistent with president trump's worldview. Enabling Russia to circumvent sanctions undermines president trump's ability to broker peace in Ukraine, a top foreign policy priority for this white house. The Georgian dream also falsely claims that western officials are pressuring Georgia to open a second front against Russia, referring to these people as the global war party. This is nonsense, and it is important to set the record straight. I have never heard anyone in Washington, D.C. Suggest that Georgia should open up a second front against Russia. The long 

[3:17:10 PM]

standing policy regarding Georgia's two occupied regions, based on a nonuse of force pledge dating back to 2010, remains the best policy for Georgia to to pursue. Mr. Chairman, in a Riverside park in Tbilisi, there's a bronze statue of Ronald Reagan facing north towards Russia. For Georgians, it symbolizes how far they have come since the soviet times and how bright their future can be for the west. It recalls that the cold war did not simply end, but that it was one. It was one because liberty and capitalism trumped oppression and communism. And these ideas turned out to be more powerful than any army that nato had to field. Lasting partnerships like that between the us and Georgia require effort from both sides, though. Though Moscow's grip is painful, it has only been a short chapter in Georgia's long and proud history. In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, when it comes to Georgia, us policy makers should be strategic. We should 

[3:18:10 PM]

play the long game and we should be ready to get the relationship back on track when the circumstances allow. I love Georgia, the Georgian people, the food, the wine, the culture. And I know one thing you never bet against the Georgian people and their resilience. Thank you. 
>> Thank you very much, Mr. Coffee. We appreciate your enthusiasm. Uh, which will begin with questions now. And I will enforce the five minutes beginning in on me, except that I'm going to let the first five minutes go to congressman Cohen, our ranking member. And then, because I want to give a chance to the other members who are here today and ranking member Cohen of Tennessee. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Let me ask this question to the group. Um, what influence did radio free Europe play, if any, in Georgia? Madam president, do you have a perspective on radio free Europe and the importance it was in, in Georgia? 
>> Uh, yeah, in Georgia it was radio liberty. Uh, and I remember from, my husband, uh, 

[3:19:11 PM]

that when he was young, uh, and he and his fellow students were listening radio liberty at night, whether one could catch radio liberty. And that was what forged, uh, really the first contacts with the west, uh, and the possibilities to have this communication established. And then on, uh, over the years, uh, radio liberty had an extremely important role, uh, in educating, I would say, the young generation of Georgians, uh, and maybe today's spirit of freedom that is still inspiring them, uh, comes from there and was sustained over the years because more recently, uh, the the role of the radio liberty, uh, and then radio free Europe has been to be part of the 

[3:20:13 PM]

intellectual scene, uh, and the free thinking scene in Georgia. 
>> Thank you. Ma'am. Mr. Coffee or miss Shelley? Yes. Yeah. Thank you. If you'd like to add concerning radio liberty. 
>> Just one sentence. Uh, when we talk about the Chinese influence operations in Georgia or fighting propaganda radio free Europe, radio liberty was probably one of the most instrumental tools, uh, and successful at the same time in disclosing, uh, investigating and reporting about those, uh, malign activities in Georgia, uh, in a very polarized, politically polarized media environment. There are only a handful of media outlets that stand truly independent and unbiased in their reporting. Um, and radio, uh, Europe, uh, radio free Europe. Radio liberty definitely is one of those. 
>> Thank you. Mr. Coffee. Do 

[3:21:14 PM]

you think the demise of radio Europe, radio liberty and free Europe is is harmful to the prospects of the United States in Georgia having a democratic society in Georgia once again? 
>> Yeah, I do agree with that. In fact, I've written on how we should be expanding these programs and modernizing to the for the 21st century. These were very effective tools. During the cold war, I was speaking to someone who lived on the other side of the iron curtain during the cold war, and he said back then, voice of America, radio free Europe, radio liberty was cool. It was about, you know, Ford mustangs, rock and roll, Marlboro reds. And now it's, uh, it's it's a bit stale and it needs updating, um, for the, for the modern age. And also, I think we need to understand how people consume their information and media in the 21st century. And I think we should think more creatively about different language services that we provide to reach more local communities, not only in the south caucasus but the broader eurasian region. 
>> How effective was said in 

[3:22:15 PM]

Georgia? 
>> Oh, that's the very big chunk of us presence in Georgia. And one can say, uh, surely that the whole health system and education system, uh, and agricultural development there, together with the European investments, but those three main fields, uh, were, uh, the essence of the presence of the Americans. And the said was very instrumental. 
>> Health care, education. And what was the third one? 
>> Uh, agricultural development, education and health. 
>> And that was. 
>> And what is the remaining today is just a small part in the health sector with the Lugar institute, which is essential because if we're talking about prevention of epidemics, viruses, uh, Lugar has been central, uh, in Georgia and in the caucasus. 

[3:23:15 PM]

>> And the Georgian people were aware of that and aware that that was the United States aid. 
>> They were very aware. And you can go around Georgia, uh, in the smallest villages, uh, and you see the stamps of said, uh, in different, uh, where they have the equipment for the agriculture or the schools. 
>> Mr. Wilson is going to call my five minutes in about 10s. Uh, Mr. Ivanishvili is a businessman. He does business, right. Does he do business with China? Does he make money out of these relationships with Iran and China and Russia? Or is it just a philosophical thing? 
>> The main characteristic of Mr. Ivanishvili's business is that it's completely nontransparent. 
>> Mr. Coffee or Mr. 
>> Uh, can I. 
>> Please. 
>> If I can respond to that? Um, absolutely. Yes. There is an evidence based, uh, research, uh, available, uh, that proves that Mr. Ivanishvili personally is involved with the Chinese 

[3:24:16 PM]

businesses, one of the very first cases that we investigated, starting in 2018 was of a very famous Chinese company, cefc. I believe some of you might remember it is the company whose CEO was arrested here at JFK carrying volumes of cash, uh, with him bribing un, uh, high officials. Uh, that's the company who holds some stakes in Georgia and even offshore companies where his name is shown. It's very transparent. It's all on record. Uh, we're linked. Uh, this is how it all started. This is how bringing Georgia on Chinese orbit has started with this huge deal in, uh, which is one of the seaports of Georgia, um, even really linked up to this very, uh, famously corrupt Chinese company. Uh, even after those guys were arrested here in New York, even after there was an investigation in different parts of the world, they still carry on and continue cooperation with them. 

[3:25:17 PM]

And that's not the only case, but that's one of the cases that is very well documented and investigated by us. 
>> Thank you. And I yield back. 
>> Thank you indeed. 
>> Thank you very much. We now proceed to doctor Gregory Murphy from North Carolina. 
>> Over here. 
>> Thank you all for. 
>> Coming today. Uh, I just sit back and I'm scrolling on my phone. I have to admit my ignorance just of what's all that's going on, but I, uh, I, um, I just, um, I'm sorry that you're having to go through it, but I applaud you that you're still pushing through it. Is there any evidence that, um, the Russian or Chinese military have had anything to do with the Georgian military? 
>> Um, we don't have direct, uh, so far, fortunately, there is no direct cooperation between the two on military level, uh, army to army level. But in 2020, when, um, former minister, former prime minister came back to the government as a minister 

[3:26:18 PM]

of defense, very first procurement contracts were concluded with the, uh, with another Chinese company that was later on, uh, blacklisted and sanctioned by the us government. Ukrainians, lots of European governments. That was for the um, air defense systems. Um, that's how it all started. There is a cooperation at the military academy as well, uh, with the students. So from the us programs, we moved to China programs. Uh, but most importantly, when it comes to the national security issues and Chinese involvement, that will be what Luke mentioned. Uh, with the surveillance cameras, we did a serious investigation to the case, and there are hundreds of, uh, cameras, millions of dollars paid to the Chinese companies, all of them sanctioned by the us government. All of them. Every single one of them. But Georgian government keeps buying equipment from them. Uh, and using against the protesters. These are the tools they use 

[3:27:19 PM]

for identifying the dissent and then, um, hunting them down and arresting them using the ai installed in Chinese cameras that are used on the streets of Tbilisi for the last, uh, year and year and a half, uh, the procurement has increased dramatically. And obviously it's all China sourced. And, uh, we've got them installed at the ministry of defense as well. So unfortunately, the army that is supposed to be going to nato and cooperating with the us army at the same time is using Chinese America sanctioned Chinese surveillance cameras installed at the ministry of defense. 
>> Interesting. Um. 
>> And the field in which there is also very, uh, increasingly links is the intelligence field, uh, which there it has been growing extensively in the in the past two years. And there are, uh, evidences of visits of fsb officials that are directly linked to Mr. Ivanishvili that 

[3:28:20 PM]

have been visiting Georgia back and forth without any restrictions, uh, on the border and our initially, the prosecutor general that has been sanctioned by the united States and who is, uh, because he has links with the fsb, has now become a Russian citizen, uh, and named Ivanov, has changed his name. 
>> Has has the unduly elected leader, uh, has he been out in public much? I was just looking that seemingly he now and Putin and XI are into the regenerative medicine living forever kind of thing. Um, whereas has he been out? I can just give him a little message. He's not going to live forever. Just medicine's not there. 
>> Well, he would love to. 
>> Yeah. Um. Well, I'll yield back. Thank you. Please persist. 
>> Thank you very much, doctor 

[3:29:20 PM]

Murphy. And we now proceed to congressman Marc Veasey from Texas. 
>> Uh, Mr. Chairman, uh, thank you very much. Madam president, I want to thank you for also being here today. Uh, just because the relationship between the us and Georgia, uh, we need for it to be a strong relationship. And we need for Georgia to obviously remain a, uh, independent. Uh, uh, republic, uh, that is recognized by the eu and the rest of the world. And so I want to thank you for in your country, for your, your, your bravery. I wanted to ask you I do have a lot of question, but I did there was something that I. That I've been curious about that I wanted to ask you, how would do you think election observation, how would that be helpful in the type of situation that Georgia finds itself in? Now. 
>> That's a question I like. Uh, because I think and the last elections that we've had, the parliamentary elections that 

[3:30:20 PM]

were rigged in big dimensions with the support, the interference, uh, and the technology that Russia provided and propaganda, uh, is something that we should be looking, uh, closer than we have been looking at, uh, because the same, uh, not exactly the same, but adapted to each country, but the same strategy has been used and tempted, uh, against Romania, uh, against Moldova. Uh, we'll see what happens in other countries that have are having elections. Uh, so it's something that can be spread around to other countries. Uh, and I think that the tools that the western democracies have, uh, to counter this type of rigging the elections, uh, are not, uh, efficient today. The classical, uh, observation missions that we've had over 

[3:31:21 PM]

the past 30 years in Georgia, uh, are not, uh, able today to detect the type of sophisticated manipulation of elections that we've had where there was a use, for instance, of 3000 call centers. That is something that you cannot see when you go to any polling station. Uh, there are many, many things that were happening. The manipulation, the pressure on the people through their jobs or through their family links or through their medical expenses, because you control all the personal data, uh, and the head of the personal data agency, uh, who was a woman, had been fired a one year ago. So it's a long term planning of rigging of the elections. 
>> What can be done? Like what? What do you think? Since traditional observation may not be enough, what do you think? 
>> First of all, we have we which has not been done. There was some, uh, attempt or ideas 

[3:32:22 PM]

in the European union to send a mission to study what has happened. Uh, and that never happened. But we should look, uh, clearly, concretely in how elections are rigged in different cases. Uh, and, uh, devise new instruments to counter this rigging of elections. I cannot say in advance what would be the ideal observation mission, but what I can say is that the means that we have today are no longer sufficient to counter these massive attacks, that we've had soft attacks. 
>> Let me ask you this. In the brief time that I have, I'm a co-sponsor of the maghaberry act, uh, which is designed to hold corrupt officials accountable while reaffirming us support for the Georgian people. How do you think this legislation would be helpful to Georgia? Uh, and how do you think that would make ordinary Georgians, you know, feel as far as them being them having 

[3:33:23 PM]

support, you know, from the us? Uh, and, and also how they're viewed in the European union. 
>> Well, if there is one thing in Georgia that, uh, is really inspiring people, it's a sense of justice or injustice, um, and what they have not been seeing is from our partners outside, uh, the feeling and the demonstration of the fact that people that are responsible, uh, directly for what is happening in the country, uh, for these tragedies and for these really, uh, suppression of all the freedoms are not held accountable and are not responsible anywhere. So some limited sanctions have taken place. Uh, but there is a feeling of, uh, the generally in the population, uh, that those people continue to benefit of their privileges, they continue to travel, uh, they continue to amass huge 

[3:34:25 PM]

sums of money. And what we've seen in the last weeks, uh, are internal feuds within the ruling party where they're accusing each other of having stolen $300 million, $200 million and asked to bring back part of this money to the party or to, uh, some pockets, I don't know. Uh, so all of that is very shocking for the normal citizen of Georgia. Uh, and the normal citizen is wondering whether, uh, these very powerful partners of us, European union and united States, really cannot do anything more, uh, than what has been done until now. 
>> Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
>> Thank you very much, congressman. We now proceed. We continue in Texas. Okay. So we've got councilman Jake Ellzey. 
>> Thank you. Joe, thank you for holding this hearing. And, uh, uh, president and minister, thank you for being here. And 

[3:35:25 PM]

first, I'd like to say watch out for yourself because we know who the enemy is. And evil can never be eradicated. It can only be suppressed. And if we take our feet off of the neck of evil, it emerges stronger yet again. In 1994, we made a deal with the Russians and the Ukrainians that we would not allow them to be attacked, and if they were, we would back them. If they just gave up their nuclear weapons. In 2005 2008, Georgia was stood side by side with us, and I was flying over the skies of Afghanistan. I was flying over the skies of Iraq in my super hornet. Um, you guys were right there with us on a per capita basis, more than any other country. And we're still right here with you. But it's been 30 years. It seems like yesterday since the rose revolution. And you think you've got these hard fought battles. But after 26 years in power, Vladimir Putin has shown that he is the enemy. And the enemy only kills, steal and 

[3:36:27 PM]

destroy. And that's in the bible. And he is proving himself to do that. And his unnatural, um, fascination, his obsession with Stalin makes Georgia a mark. So in 2008, when he was going to see, he was going to see what the countries of the free world would do if he started down this path, the shot heard round the world about what Vladimir Putin's true intentions were in his power started in Georgia, and then it went on from there. And it really doesn't matter what you see in the news. This is proof where we have just a few members, but we're all very busy doing other things. And I, as I apologized and apologize to you, I've been stepping out to do votes on appropriations committee hearing right across. But I'm deeply interested in this, and I care deeply about your country. I don't have any questions today. And we can talk about the the corruption. But ultimately this is big, big evil versus good going after them. And it looks a lot like 19, 38, 39 and 40 to me right 

[3:37:27 PM]

now with four nations with genocidal tendencies and all these four nations, the Iranians, the north Koreans, the Russians and the Chinese are actively committing or have plans for genocide for the countries that they want to take over. What they're doing in Ukraine is not a war. It is a genocide. They have designs and they're doing false flags with Finland right now, they are claiming that Finland is going to attack them. The playbook is being heard over and over and over again. I'm very proud that Europe is standing up the way they are. We need to keep in mind that Georgia has always been there for us, and they are a western oriented country that we need to continue to support in any way we can. Because when you're not paying attention, people like Putin gobbles up small nations of small populations, but with a lot of spirit because he's the enemy. And I'm not afraid to say that because he's proven it. And so there are more than you might see up here, and there are more in congress than you might see on any TV station who still 

[3:38:28 PM]

believe in the ideals of freedom and democracy around the world. And it doesn't have to look like ours, but ultimately we believe in it. And we'll support. And especially with Joe Wilson, who has been a strong advocate. I mean, everywhere he goes, you want to know what we really think? Ask Joe Wilson. We understand the cost of Vladimir Putin being able to pick off small nations. We don't want to see that. So while some nations are a member of nato, we know what's coming and we're paying attention to history. If we don't pay attention to history, the whole world will be engulfed again. So Putin has to be stopped. Georgian dream has to be stopped. And I just want to say, with just a little time that we're on your side and I think it will manifest itself in real, real ways. And, uh, and so stay strong, but watch yourself because we know what the enemy does. Thank you. 
>> Thank you very much. And yes, please. 
>> Just react to to that. Uh, I 

[3:39:30 PM]

fully share what you've said on, on 2008 that Russia was testing in Georgia, uh, the renewed military aggression that we had known from the soviet times and before. But for the first time, the new Russia was testing its military aggression in Georgia. And in fact, after the aggression in Georgia, it revised its military strategy. Some components of the military force, some modernization. So it was really a test case for, uh, for Russia. And that's from this test case that they moved to crimea, uh, and then to 2022, what I think is happening today, uh, is that the, uh, military aggression on Ukraine has not worked in the way that Mr. Putin was expecting. Uh, in fact, he has suffered a defeat, militarily speaking, uh, because three years and a half for the big Russian military, then without succeeding to move. But some kilometers is not a 

[3:40:30 PM]

success. Uh, and so without publicly admitting that and continuing certainly their attempts to reduce Ukraine, uh, they are looking at, uh, alternative strategies. Uh, and Georgia is again the test case for the alternative strategy. And the alternative strategy is how do you capture a state without arms, but with rigged elections, propaganda, some money, but not that's not the decisive form. Uh, and, uh, the proxy government that. 
>> Georgia and Moldova are both suffering from, that right now. 
>> Are both in the same situation. Moldova saved itself, uh, thanks to the diaspora, which we could not use, uh, because despite all our efforts, we were not allowed to, uh, and I didn't have the power that Maia sandu had, uh, to open the precincts that we needed, uh, in, uh, the foreign countries 

[3:41:31 PM]

because our diaspora, which is, uh, 1 million more, uh, out of 4 million within Georgia, was not practically not allowed to vote because just 17,000 persons were allowed to vote. Uh, so we were not saved by the diaspora. We were not saved by the constitutional court. And like in Romania, because our constitutional court already was under the full control of the one party system. So this trilogy of rigging elections, propaganda and proxy government is something that if it works in Georgia to the end and we're still resisting that, if it works, it will be used elsewhere. That's a given. 
>> Well. 
>> I'll just like to close by saying this is that evil is ruthless. We learned that in I mean, it's always been true in in World War two. That's the only way we won. They eat 

[3:42:33 PM]

kindness for a snack. They eat deals and negotiations for a snack. And I just hope that the western powers recognize. How do you how do you push back against that? Um, without going to worldwide conflagration. And it has to happen. But kindness is not the path. And I just hope we don't have to redo this because we, we, we've forgotten what history has shown us. 
>> And indeed, thank you so much, congressman. And, um, madam president, um, defense minister, senior fellow. I'm on my five minutes. And so but I would just want to we could tell you the American people are with you. Okay. But you can see it. Uh, you've got a Democrat, amazingly, a Democrat, a Republican, uh, and Republican standing together and and they are there. Oh, my god. And and standing together. Okay. Uh, and I want to reiterate the vote for the mega 

[3:43:33 PM]

in the house of representatives was 348 to 42. Okay. There's no other bill that I'm aware of that's had that much support. We it's just an automatic, uh, issues and democratic societies. People don't always agree. Uh, we already know it's the worst system there is, except for all the others. But. And so it's really unusual to have a 90% support. But that's what the American people truly believe. And. And why? Because we've been inspired by the people of Georgia. And so we want the people of Georgia to, um, ultimately prevail. And I, uh, I really want to give credit to both of these gentlemen that it's just so inspiring to hear both of them understand what the issues are and how, uh, we will be standing and and, madam president, you're so correct. Uh, indeed. Um, Mr. Putin, uh, just miscalculated. He told his troops he lied to them. Can you believe it? Uh, where he told them to take their dress uniforms for the parade? Uh, in Kyiv. Well, there was no parade. 

[3:44:35 PM]

They didn't make it, and they're not going to make it. The people of Ukraine are going to stand up. Did he ever imagine that Sweden would join nato? Uh, 200 years of neutrality given up, given up with the extraordinary defense capabilities. And then the brave people of Finland. Uh. How incredible. He claimed he didn't want to have nato next door. Well, he's got it 830 miles. Uh, he already had 120. And Norway. Okay. So, uh, over and over again, uh, it's the people of Georgia have been an inspiration to others standing up. And then I'm really grateful to that. Uh, indeed. Nato is standing firm as never before. Uh, and we see that, uh, president trump stands firm. Uh, he sent javelin missiles to help Ukraine stop a war criminal. Putin. He put American troops in Poland to stop war criminal Putin. He stopped nord stream two to stop the financing of war. Kremlin. Putin. So I'm confident that president trump, uh, will be working, uh, as he successfully 

[3:45:35 PM]

is. Uh, and then we have to put it in context to that. Now, nato is at 5%. Who would ever imagine and how and what that means for the people of Georgia, that nato is more united than ever. And then who would ever imagine that your next door neighbors, okay, Armenia and Azerbaijan, uh, president aliyev and prime minister pashayan would be meeting in the oval office of the united States with the president of the United States to sign agreements for a pipeline. No, it's really pretty cool. It's called the trump pipeline. Um, but the bottom line is that, um, you're again, so much of this has been an inspiration by the people of Georgia standing up, not giving up. Uh, and you've inspired your neighbors. Uh, and so I'm just very, very hopeful and, uh, but, madam president, indeed, something the American people need to know more about. The rigged elections in Georgia. Uh, with the rigged elections in Georgia, we know that the national endowment for democracy, the international Republican institute, the national 

[3:46:35 PM]

democratic institute, um, the osce, every independent organization, uh, pointed out that the elections were rigged. And I'm glad you pointed out something that Americans can understand. And sadly, this has not been published. And that is the Georgians abroad, uh, were not able to vote, uh, that the diaspora and there are so many here today, and Georgian Americans are so prominent in our country. But we saw in Moldova, because they did, uh, moldovans abroad were able to vote. And that was the difference, to, uh, stop the subversion by, uh, president Putin. And so, uh, are there other examples that you can, uh, again, verify how the elections were rigged and what can be done to, uh, address this in the future? 
>> Well, there was the. 
>> The elections in Romania. Yes. Where the it was a different technology that was used. Uh, it was through tiktok and social networks that the 

[3:47:36 PM]

propaganda was what we know about Moldova today, where we are going to see the next elections pretty soon, uh, is that the Russians have opened bank accounts in Russia, uh, for, uh, Moldovan citizens that they cannot use because there are sanctions and it cannot be used today. But they promised them that as soon as they will vote to overthrow the the current government, then they will open up these accounts and allow them to, uh, benefit from the sums of money that have been put on those accounts. So that's just one of the small maybe, but technologies that are being used and there are as many as can invent, uh, the fsb services that know very well. And that's something that we have to keep in mind, is that all these countries from the former soviet space. And I hate these words, but, uh, they have been studying these countries 

[3:48:37 PM]

forever. Uh, they know the mentality, they know some of the habits, and they know those countries very well. So they can adapt their strategies to, to each and every country. 
>> Well, hey, as we conclude again, thank you. And it is very perceptive that the military conquest, that war criminal Putin thought he can achieve, he's not going to do it. And so that he's going to use democracy against itself. And so then people need to see that. Except that indeed he failed in Moldova, he failed in Romania. Uh, and so over and over again, we need to be ever vigilant. And we know his failures and Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and, um, and a final point. What a reminder today, uh, there were 19, maybe 23, uh, drones launched out of the puppet state, uh, of, uh, again, another rigged election. Belarus. Okay. And so, uh, but drones were launched over nato territory in Poland today, and, 

[3:49:38 PM]

uh, it's not an accident. It was over nearly 100 miles. The American people need to know this. This was not an incursion on the border. Uh, it was an intrusion into the country. And it was a testing, just as you had the testing of south ossetia and abkhazia. Um, how is the world can react? And I'm just confident, uh, president trump has had some, um, not friendly statements about Mr. Putin today. And so, uh, and that's going to be followed, I'm confident, by sanctions, by secondary sanctions. It's going to be provided by, uh, Europe, uh, finally coming together, uh, with the encouragement of people like admiral Margaret kibben to provide that there would be, uh, no sale or purchase of oil and gas, uh, from dictator, war criminal Putin. And so, uh, what an incredible time in history. And but every day, uh, war criminal in my view is mocking president trump. He's insulting president trump. Uh, and, uh, but there will be consequences, um, as

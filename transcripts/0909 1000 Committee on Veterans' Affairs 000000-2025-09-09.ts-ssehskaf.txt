==================================


>> Everyone. Uh, I expect many 

[9:46:03 AM]

of my colleagues to join us. There's. Some of them are still in, uh, the caucus meeting this morning. Um, and, of course, we're up against the national defense authorization act and some horrible amendments. Uh, and so we I thank you for accommodating us by joining us a little earlier this morning. Um, and, uh, but this is, uh, such a rich and complex, complex topic. And, uh, I am just honored that you all have answered our our our call to help, uh, to help us understand this topic, uh, more thoroughly and better. Um, uh, I just want to thank you for this roundtable discussion about how profit seeking motivations and health care are impacting veterans and va. And I was thinking about this as I was going to sleep last night. I'm I am, I am I don't call myself 

[9:47:06 AM]

a democratic socialist. I still I'm there's a generational divide. Uh, and I understand what my friend AOC and mayor. The future mayor of New York, is up to. Uh, but, uh, you know, I I've seen my own lifetime, the excesses of of ideologies both on the left and the right. And so I'm not tearing down market capitalism or the idea of liberal liberal democracy. Um, what I'm seeking is, uh, humane, humane capitalism. Uh, and your work is all about the circumscribing of what the limits of the efficiency of, of, of markets, markets can do, especially in healthcare, is where it kind of breaks down. Healthcare is where it, uh, profit motivations can become 

[9:48:08 AM]

perverse. Uh, and have inhumane, inhumane outcomes. So we have assembled a diverse and esteemed set of experts for today's roundtable. We're joined by researchers, physicians, surgeons, policy advisers, attorneys, even a Pennsylvania state senator. And I want to welcome senator cappelletti. Senator cappelletti, um, and welcome to you all. And I am eager to learn from you all and to engage in a discussion about the financialization of healthcare, the impact of profit seeking behavior. And, I might just add, perverse profit seeking behavior, because profit seeking in my mind is not necessarily an evil in itself, but without proper guardrails, without proper checks on accountability, it becomes perverse. And our American medical system is remarkable. Uh, and it's remarkable for some reasons. Um, 

[9:49:08 AM]

uh, and veterans who receive care both in and outside of va are not immune to these perverse effects. And while profit will always exist in our healthcare system, it should never be the dominant force. And unfortunately, over over time, it has risen to become the singular driving factor in much of American medicine. For something so foundational, so integral to our existence as human beings, medicine should seek to serve the patient, not ultimately the shareholders. And yet, over the past century, Wall Street has increasingly required health care entities across the country to prioritize profits at the expense of quality, access and cost to the patient. Financial motivations dominate our American health care system. That distinction is what sets va apart and why protecting its mission driven model is so important. At va. The mission is clear to serve veterans first and foremost. The priority is to provide high 

[9:50:08 AM]

quality care to our nation's veterans. However, as we have seen a forceful push by my colleagues across the aisle to shift more veteran care into the private sector, veterans are increasingly subject to a system motivated by dollar signs rather than vital signs. The difference in mission and motivation between va and non va health care facilities extends even beyond veteran care, and as exemplified in their contrasting responses to national crises. For example, during the covid 19 pandemic, private equity backed healthcare facilities tightened spending, while emergency department staffing firms cut workforce work hours for physicians and nurses and other health care professionals, ostensibly in response to lower revenue from elective procedures. While for profit healthcare facilities step back, va actually stepped up from March 2020 to June 2022. Va 

[9:51:12 AM]

supported the response to the public health emergency by completing 196 FEMA mission assignments. Among other things, va provided inpatient hospital care to nearly 700 civilians, deployed hundreds of its nurses to help staff, non va nursing homes and hospitals, and delivered more than 1 million pieces of ppe to non va facilities that were experiencing shortages. Mission driven healthcare saves lives well, often private driven healthcare endangers them in this context, definitely endangering them. We know this is the case from what we learned from the covid 19 public health emergency. And I remember asking doctor stone, va's then acting secretary, undersecretary for health during the early days of covid, if he was requesting enough money for va to weather the storm, initially gave me a number that was, I thought, 

[9:52:12 AM]

inadequate. And he was. He had enough integrity to understand as he came back to me later and he says, Mr. Chairman, I want to take a second crack at my request. Um, and he, you know, we we actually did appropriate a lot of money for him. Um, I wanted to make sure that va was then adequately funded because a government that cares about its people must play a different role than a company worried about its quarterly profit statements. We just have two different roles today. We'll hear from experts who have extensively researched the detrimental effects of profit incentives in healthcare on quality, access and cost. Many studies have shown that patient outcomes are worse in for profit facilities, and that they have higher readmission rates than va hospitals. We also know that one of the primary tactics private equity firms use after acquiring a healthcare facility is to cut staff, which inevitably leads to a decline in care quality 

[9:53:13 AM]

and access. Physicians, surgeons and nurses deserve to work in environments where they are supported to provide the best care they can to patients not encouraged to find ways to cut costs to serve shareholders. We have heard story after story about how private equity acquisitions of hospitals have led to facility closures, resulting in diminished access to care and communities across the country. All the while, the owners get richer as they squeeze every penny they can out of their purchase. And many of these healthcare systems sold to private equity as a last resort because they were on the brink of closure. Yet private equity did not provide the saving grace they needed to actually keep their doors open long term. So when we couple private profit motivations in healthcare, with the changes to medicaid and medicare coming down the pike from the big ugly bill, I worry about how hospitals in rural communities will survive and how veterans 

[9:54:15 AM]

who rely on these those facilities, uh, for care, will be affected as healthcare costs continue to skyrocket in the private sector. Those costs are eating into va's direct care budget, impacting va's ability to provide care to veterans itself. In the last six months alone, va has transferred over $1.5 billion from its direct care budget to cover growing the growing expense of care in the community. I worry that these rising costs can be associated with for profit health systems engaging in predatory billing practices like upcoding, which the va inspector general has identified as an issue with community care providers. Even more worrisome is that we have left oversight of the community care program to third party administrators who have a vested profit motivation in the health care, uh, providers, veterans see outside of va 

[9:55:18 AM]

overbilling the agency, because that means that they, the third party administrators are the third party administrators, like optum, which is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth group, will also be a pocket more money. This behavior is insidious and poses an existential threat to va care, essentially, va direct care and the care that veterans, the care that veterans rely on. So with that, um, I want to begin our roundtable discussion. And first, uh, I would like to go around the table and everyone briefly introduce themselves, um, and where you're from, just very briefly, because we want the focus to be on the subject matter today. So when we start to my left, since I'm left handed. Glenn.

[10:00:21 AM]

>> Great. Well, I see that you all have been studying this in a very organized way, using your academic training, your legal training, um, and, um, uh, it's an honor for me to have you all here and to benefit from your expertise. I want to make sure that I introduce my colleagues, um, and in order of seniority, uh, congresswoman Sheila cherfilus-mccormick, uh, from the state of Florida. Um, I, uh, you're you work on the subcommittee on health and technology. Health and technology. We are very fortunate to have physician members of congress on the committee, uh, and from state of New Jersey doctor Conaway, um, and from the state of Minnesota, uh, representative Morrison and I expect other members will be joining us, and 

[10:01:21 AM]

they'll be coming and going as, uh, as their schedules permit. But I want to thank all my colleagues for being here. Thank you all. Um, uh, I want to thank you all for being here. My hope is for this to be a free flowing discussion, but I'm going to chime in periodically with questions for our participants. Uh, if you'd like to be recognized at any point, please turn your name card. Um, so it stands, uh, vertically, and, um, you can place it back down after your, after you're recognized. I have, um, Ali here to write down in the name that we see the cards go up. Um, that's our way of, uh, of organizing this discussion. Um, so I'm going to first, but I'm going to turn first to doctor Figueroa, uh, and doctor Tsai from my Alma mater, Harvard. Okay. Some of you may be out there. My Alma mater is also the university of California, Riverside. Uh, it's my for my constituents. Don't tell anyone. Don't tell anyone. 

[10:02:22 AM]

I went to Harvard. Okay. Uh, and their colleagues, uh, Mr. Brown, Mr. Singh, miss brown, miss brown and doctor Singh and doctor Myers from brown university. Uh, I understand you have some data to share with us related to the overlap of private equity, um, owned health care facilities and where veterans are receiving their care outside of va. So I'd like you to share your findings with us and your thoughts on how we, as policymakers should respond. So, um, uh, we'll begin with, uh, with doctors Figueroa and doctor Tsai. 
>> Uh, thank you, representative Takano. I we were asked by your staff if if there was any evidence out there to, to tell us to what extent are veterans being cared for at pe backed hospitals? And we use veteran data linked with medicare data to try to answer the question between 2022 to 2024, which is the data we had at hand. To what extent are 

[10:03:22 AM]

veterans being hospitalized or or showing up in emergency rooms? And that number between that three year period increased up to 55,000 episodes. Emergency medicine visits and hospitalizations in 2024, which was an increase of 20% to pe backed hospitals in 2024 alone. About $250 million, um, were paid by the va for episodes at non va facilities that are owned or operated by pe investors. Um, and that's just what the va paid for, because many veterans are also eligible for medicare. About half of us veterans enroll in either traditional medicare or medicare advantage. And if you include the dollars paid by the medicare program, that number triples. And in 2022, which is the data that we had available linked with the va and the 

[10:04:22 AM]

medicare, if you add what the va paid for and what the medicare program paid for, um, that number jumps up, uh, to 37.5, um, billion total, of which a certain percentage goes to the pe backed hospitals. So I will pass it over to my colleagues to, to to talk about, um, the, um, the role that occurs in the private outpatient, uh, pe backed outpatient providers. 
>> Thank you very much. I can share a little bit about private equity investments in outpatient settings. So this includes physician practices across a whole range of specialties, as well as ambulatory surgery centers. Um, so this is a trend that has attracted private investors starting in 2015. And so it's fairly recent compared to peace and flow into hospitals and long term care facilities. Research we've done shows that 

[10:05:23 AM]

pe investments in outpatient settings increases the cost to commercial payers in the ballpark of 10 to 25%. This is driven predominantly by changes to physician practice patterns, billing patterns and overuse of ancillary services such as lab tests and diagnostic imaging services, as well as services that have um at best dubious value to the patient. Um. This is also driven by changes to referral patterns that favor co-owned providers. Um, again, the benefit to the patient is unclear. When we look at the effects of these investments on the medicare program, we've done additional work that shows private equity investments, changed the prescribing patterns of heartbeat drugs to favor drugs that are more expensive and thus worth more from a revenue standpoint to the practices that get acquired. All of these changes result in increases to medicare spending by about 20%. Following pe investments in these outpatient settings. When we think about 

[10:06:23 AM]

these research findings in the context of va enrollees, I did want to highlight that given that this is a fairly recent trend compared to pe investments in hospitals and nursing homes, um, the geographic scope of pe at present is limited to urban settings and urban areas, whereas a lot of community care that is billed by physicians to the va tends to happen more in rural areas. And so while there does not seem to be an extensive overlap in geographies that both build community care claims to the va and geographies that are most exposed to pe, given the existing ties and propensity to increase utilization and spending, we recommend that this be an area that we pay closer attention to. 
>> Two other members arrived. Um, the ranking member of our health subcommittee, uh, my colleague from California, Julia Brownley. Um, and, uh, doctor Maxine Dexter from, uh, 

[10:07:25 AM]

the state of Oregon. 
>> And she. 
>> Oh, um, and and, uh, Jacqueline del mar just briefly introduce herself because she walked in, uh, after we began. 
>> Thank you for having me. I apologize for being late. Um, my name is Jacqueline. I'm the president and CEO of the anti fraud coalition, which is a bipartisan nonprofit devoted to whistleblowers and whistleblower laws. Um, so that's. 
>> Thank you. Thank you for being here. We'll continue with the, uh, the. Are we going to go with this now? Okay. So. Well, thank you for that. That brief overview from both, um, uh, the Harvard and brown folks, um, I want to thank I want to turn to doctor. Uh, is it Bruce? Doctor Bruce. Doctor Bruch from the university of Chicago. Uh, doctor, how can private equity takeovers of hospitals affect patient outcomes and hospital finances? And how does this 

[10:08:27 AM]

relate to the broader financialization of healthcare for veterans? 
>> Great. Thank you, congressman Takano, and the committee for inviting me. Um, so I'll start first on the private equity and hospitals and hospitals, and then I can talk more broadly about financialization. So in recent years, there's been a large number of studies that have been looking specifically at what happens when hospitals are acquired by private equity. Generally, we use mostly the members of this, uh, roundtable. We look at what happens when a private equity firm takes over a healthcare organization and compare those changes with another healthcare organization that's not acquired by private equity. So several years ago, we looked at this question, and what we found was, is that after acquisition, private equity acquired hospitals, uh, became more profitable relative to those not acquired by private equity. But they did so in part by charging patients more, by potentially increasing 

[10:09:30 AM]

the case mix index, potentially a sign of upcoding, as well as by increasing their charge to cost ratios. Other, uh, analyzes by professor tong liu found increased prices at private equity acquired hospitals. Um other analyzes by our colleagues and colleagues found that private equity acquired hospitals were more likely to rely on higher, profitable service lines and less likely to rely on less profitable service lines. So we conducted a systematic review of all private equity acquisitions in healthcare. Um, led by Alexander Borsa at Columbia university. And broadly, what we found in hospitals was consistent across the board, which is that patients experience higher costs following private equity acquisitions. Now, when we reviewed the literature broadly on quality of care there, the 

[10:10:30 AM]

evidence was more mixed, though leaned negative. What we saw was, especially for hospitals, some indication of reduced, say, mortality, especially for certain populations, but also evidence, including evidence that, uh, by harkonnen at Pittsburgh finding increased hospital acquired conditions as well as reduced patient satisfaction. Uh, in a study conducted by doctor botla. Um, so again, I would say when it comes to private equity, we are certainly seeing almost unambiguous evidence that the costs are higher, um, for patients. But when it comes to quality of care there, the evidence is a bit more mixed. Let me talk a little bit about financialization. Um, so it might, uh, there's no doubt private equity has received significant attention, um, especially given recent private equity bankruptcies of hospitals. But I would say that 

[10:11:31 AM]

this isn't a isolated trend in healthcare, but really reflects a larger structural shift in our economy. Namely, this is the result of financialization. Financialization means the increasing financial actors motives, uh, institutions that have transformed both our health system but our economy more broadly. So what does that mean? It means that the financial industry is the largest industry in the us, comprises over 20% of gdp, up from 10%, uh, in the 1950. And that as financial actors have taken on more and more, uh, ownership across all industries, education, housing and, yes, healthcare, we've seen what that means for consumers and for us for patients. So, um, you know, we can speak about private equity, and we've seen over $1 trillion in private equity acquisitions over the past decade. But it's not just 

[10:12:33 AM]

private equity. We've seen increased investment in hedge funds over the last two decades. We've seen a major expansion of venture capital investment in healthcare. We've also seen the rise of real estate investment trusts acquiring more and more of our healthcare real estate, acquiring the real estate and selling it back to the healthcare properties, often with escalating rental fees. With up forthcoming work by me and doctor Tsai, we see increased risk of bankruptcy and closure for hospitals that undergo these sale leasebacks. So I would just urge the committee to to focus on private equity, but also think about the ways in which financialization more broadly has transformed our health system. And so I'll just end by saying, doctor. Congressman Takano, you mentioned at the beginning a need or a commitment towards a I believe you used the word humane capitalism. And I think the work of this committee, will is ensuring that financialization does not compromise that 

[10:13:34 AM]

commitment, especially as it relates to our veterans. Thank you. 
>> Thank you, thank you very much. Doctor Gupta, uh, you've done extensive research on private equity acquisitions of nursing homes. Can you tell us a bit about the effects of private equity on staffing and patient outcomes in nursing homes, and why we should be worried about these implications for veterans? 
>> Uh, thanks. Thanks. Congressman Takano. Yes. So, uh, we've we've looked at the effects of private equity, ownership of nursing homes nationally. Uh, and there's a couple of main findings. The first main finding is that when private equity takes over nursing homes, they reduce the availability of nurses, particularly nursing aides and licensed practical nurses. Now, these are the bulk of the nursing staff at nursing homes. They account for about 80% of the hours for patients. Uh, and that's where the cuts are. We do actually see a slight increase in availability of 

[10:14:35 AM]

registered nurses. But overall there's a big decrease. It's well known that in the nursing home industry, the quality of care is directly linked to the availability of nurses. And the reason why private equity firms do this is also well known. It's because about half of the total cost at nursing homes is approximately is the nursing staff. And so this is the big lever that they can pull when they take over the nursing home in order to increase profits. Uh, in terms of quality, we find, you know, there's a reduction in patient well-being across a number of different metrics, metrics that CMS uses, uh, in order to rate nursing homes in their five star rating system. For example, uh, self-reported pain by patients, the incidence of pressure ulcers goes up, mobility goes down. And it's not just measures these measures of patient well-being. We also see an increase in the probability of death. So we see that mortality rates go up for 

[10:15:35 AM]

patients. Uh, our study was limited to medicare patients. So these numbers are all focused on medicare short stays. Other researchers have looked at the effects of private equity, ownership of nursing homes on patients who have long stays. Those are usually covered by medicaid, not medicare. But the evidence there is also consistent, uh, in that study, for example, there's a study by Larry castellino and his team at Cornell, and they found that when private equity firms take over nursing homes, long stay patients have higher rates of readmissions. So that's also consistent with this idea that when private equity takes over nursing homes, there's a reduction in quality of care. Um, this increase in mortality I should say is is fairly large. It's a 10% increase in mortality rates in the context of health economics. That's actually a very large effect. It's very hard to find effects that large. Uh, so this this really stood out. Um, and I'll also add, even though you 

[10:16:36 AM]

didn't ask me about quality, uh, going back to a comment that was made earlier by yashaswini about costs, we also find in the nursing home context that although quality goes down, medicare spending for these patients goes up. So there's actually no trade off, medicare is completely worse off and patients are also worse off. Um, mortality goes up by 10%. Spending by medicare also goes up approximately by 10%. 
>> You could you have a question? No. Uh, this is very stunning data. You're providing this. Uh, doctor Gupta, I have a question about, uh, so have you only focused on the medicare? Uh, have you looked at, uh, other, you know, uh, other than private equity, uh, forms of, uh, models out there which seem to deliver both value for medicare and the patient. Um, what types of 

[10:17:36 AM]

settings or what types of models out there, um, are you aware of, or if you haven't studied them, I mean, that's fine as well, but I'm curious. Um, so we know that private equity has a 10% increase in mortality, which is astounding. Right. 
>> Um, so one thing I should point out, actually, in our study, we compared private equity nursing homes to other for-profit nursing homes. So it's not that we're comparing them to a mix of government, nursing homes and nonprofits. This is relative to a conventional for profit nursing home. So there's other work out there that's already examined, whether for profits, how for profits compare to nonprofit nursing homes. And the evidence there is somewhat mixed. Uh, you know, some studies find that for profits are a bit worse on quality. Others find that they are more or less the same. Uh, so, so that, you know, it's difficult to say whether for profit nursing homes are truly worse than nonprofit nursing homes overall. But when you compare private equity, 

[10:18:37 AM]

which is a subset of for profit nursing homes, to just your plain vanilla private equity, plain vanilla for profit, that's not private equity owned, you find this large effect. And I'll also add that I've looked at this not just in the nursing home context. I've looked at this also in the hospital context. Uh, in another study that I've done where we've looked at what happens when government hospitals get privatized and sometimes they're taken over by for profit hospital chains, sometimes they're taken over by private equity hospital chains. And even there we find that private equity is differentially worse. So it seems like private equity is is is actually noticeably different than just your plain vanilla, for profit, hospital for profit entity. 
>> Well, thank you. Thank you for that. Go ahead, miss Baumann. And then. 
>> A lot. 

[10:19:38 AM]

>> Talked about uh, and long term care. Um, so is there a difference in terms of private equity when as it relates to short term care versus long term care? I mean, I know your study mainly talked about short term care, but, you know, there's all kinds of for profit. Um. Homes out there, assisted living kind of concepts, uh, places for, um, you know, dementia and Alzheimer's only, you know, memory care. There's all kinds of categories. And it seems as though a lot of the, these categories that are are more expensive, actually to to get in or for profit entities. Right. Um, are they, uh, are they private equity and entities or. 

[10:20:39 AM]

>> So. Uh, congresswoman Brownley, I should be careful here because I have not directly looked at assisted living and some of these other business models. Uh, but I will say that you are correct that actually this is a very big sector. It's a very growing sector, and private equity is actually heavily invested in assisted living as well. In fact, in our study, when we first were identifying private equity owned nursing homes for every private equity owned nursing home, we found maybe 5 or 6 private equity owned assisted living facility. We weren't interested in studying assisted living, senior living, broadly speaking, because medicare doesn't pay for it. You know, there's no government dollars per se. And the data that we had was limited to medicare patients. But you're absolutely right that private equity is actually heavily invested in all of these sort of adjacent business models. Uh, I actually don't know about their effects on quality or spending in these particular 

[10:21:39 AM]

business models. Maybe one of my colleagues here, uh, might be might know if there's some studies out there on this. Um, and, uh, it is uh, it has been growing rapidly, uh, over the, over the last decade, basically in parallel with their expansion into nursing homes, which are covered by medicare and medicaid. They've also expanded into these business models. 
>> 65% of our aging veterans are in nursing homes. So it's it's a very large percentage. 
>> I'll point out. Miss Brownley has been doing groundbreaking work, um, in the silver tsunami among our generally in our veterans and Elizabeth dole act was largely a result of her legislative work here. Uh, doctor Meyer and doctor, are your comments kind of relative to. Why don't you go ahead? Because I want to call on my colleague. Go ahead. 
>> I just wanted to offer some thoughts on what might make P investors different than other 

[10:22:41 AM]

types of for profit investors. Um, for profit investment in healthcare in the American healthcare system certainly is not a new phenomenon. But there are particular characteristics of private equity I think, that warrant special attention. So the first, um, one of those is the generally, investors generally tend to have a short investment focus. Um, they are not interested in long term ownership of facilities. Their sole purpose of investment is to generate a quick return, generally in the ballpark of 3 to 7 years, 3 to 10 years. It can vary depending on the specific setting. The other factor that makes P particularly unique is um. Investors generally rely on large amounts of debt to finance their acquisitions, and that debt is often placed as a financial burden on the entity that is acquired, rather than the obligation of the investors themselves to service. Um, and then finally, the thing about nursing home investments and hospital investments and I believe, assisted living facility investments as well, is the widespread use of real 

[10:23:42 AM]

estate sale and leaseback agreements, which I understand are not used as commonly by other types of investors, but are commonly deployed by pe firms to acquire the most valuable asset, the real estate, and then lease it back to the acquired entity, which then has the effect of having the entity make rental payments, as doctor mentioned earlier, and can leave the financial stability of the acquired entity particularly vulnerable. Not only have they lost their most valuable real estate asset, they now have rental payments to services as well. So a couple of factors that perhaps might help us think about pe differentially than other types of for profit or private investors. 
>> Doctor Myers yeah. 
>> And one last thing. I would just want to add quickly to sort of the topic of nursing homes, that another sort of payment and model that's entering into nursing home space pretty rapidly is the expansion of health plans. Entering into nursing home space, particularly with the growth of institutional special needs plans and insurance companies that are either purchasing nursing homes or 

[10:24:43 AM]

sometimes in partnership with private equity firms offering services in nursing facilities. And currently, the evidence is still early on what the impacts of this are. But I think that as these things are growing together and as there's a lot of insurance incentives when it comes to coding intensity and risk and sort of the nursing home space, um, there's a need for a great deal more research to understand how these other models are sort of entering into the space as well, and how that interacts with the private equity market as well. 
>> Thank you. Uh, Sheila. 
>> Thank you so much for being here. And thank you for having this conversation. Um, in my state of Florida, we've been seeing an increased number of private equity firms that are taking over our healthcare spaces. And if you ask me, I think they're all scam. Likely. Um, uh, it really is. And it's very frustrating because, um, you always look at causation versus correlation, right? They're going to give you this argument that we didn't cause this. It's just a correlation. That's what we stepped in. But realistically, you know I think we need to have a broader 

[10:25:44 AM]

conversation, not just with this committee, but with ways and means and energy and commerce. Because if you look at how we got here, it's because the reimbursement rates have been so low for, you know, private businesses or even mom and pop doctors who really have a mission to serve the community and the people they love, and they're stuck in a place where now they're not getting reimbursed. And so they need a private equity firm to come in. And the private equity firms are like piranhas looking for them and putting all these regulations and exploiting them. And so I wanted to look a little further and go into the data that you guys presented specifically when you were talking about, um, the ratio of nurses, that there are more availability when it comes to, um, registered nurses. And but there's less paraprofessionals like cnas, lpns, which those are the everyday people that identify and make sure the patient is getting healthier. It seems like in my mind that they're going to make more money because sicker patients bring in more money and sicker patients die, which increases the mortality rate. So my question is, are they using. 

[10:26:44 AM]

Have you seen an increase in technology? Because I've been hearing a lot of companies talk about, well, we have ai now and they can track and monitor the patients. So we don't need the lower level nurses. Have you seen that or are they just removing the nurses and not having that continuous care? And my second question on the same vein of that, um, with the you said nurses are available. One of the things I've been noticing also is that they'll have nurses on call, but not necessarily on site, which we've even seen that in detention centers and other places where they say, oh, we have nurses available, which doesn't give us the consistency that we need to see in care and in service. So in those two areas, if you can help expand what that is, we can just have understanding on how to treat this issue. 
>> Uh, I'll take that. I guess that was directed at me. I, um, I'll preface by saying that, you know, these are very important issues. Unfortunately, we didn't directly look at these issues in our work. Uh, it is very difficult to look at 

[10:27:45 AM]

some of these things because usually when we study these things, we these are based on big data claims, analysis of billing claims. And many of these changes in operations aren't really recorded in those types of data. Um, I will say that, um, there is no there is no discussion or that I've seen, uh, which suggests that they have been able to replace low level nurses with technology. Uh, and it seems like a difficult thing to do. Uh, but I don't have any direct evidence on this. Uh, and then, uh, remind me, what was the second question that you were asking? 
>> It was about, um, I'm trying to remember myself. Availability. When they say nurses are available. On site. Yes. 
>> Um, so I think I think there, uh, there might be some I think there might be something to what you're saying, because what we found is not only is there's a reduction in the hours recorded of these nurses, we also see a decrease in their compliance with state standards. 

[10:28:46 AM]

And those are usually linked to on site availability of nurses. So um, and that actually was not just of the low level nurses. It was also of registered nurses. Uh, so um, so I think that is consistent with the conjecture that you raised. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Thank you. I want to keep this flowing. Uh, going. Um, oh, well, we have two, uh, two additional, uh. 
>> I just wanted to quickly add that you had asked earlier if there were any models of care in nursing homes that, you know are associated with better quality. The one thing we know that is very clear in the data is the more nursing hours per resident clearly associated with better quality, lower mortality, lower rates of infections, lower rates of complications like decubitus ulcers, which is highly prevalent in nursing home population. And that's clear regardless of if it's a for profit nonprofit, P backed, not 

[10:29:46 AM]

P backed. But what we've heard is that P backed facilities are very aggressive at staff cutting, and there's also higher rates of turnovers. Uh, and those two factors contradict you know, go against what we know. The more nurses on staff taking care of residents, the higher the quality of care. And the issue that when you hear about, we have all this ai based technology where there's somebody monitoring, showing whether the resident is moving or not moving. At the end of the day, residents need to be moved, they need to be bathed, they need to be cleaned, and no amount of monitoring from a special camera will help with the daily needs of nursing home residents that are highly frail or their high levels of frailty, that physical impairment they have cognitive issues and you need, at the end of the day, you need people taking care of people, and that's something that that needs to be put front and forward. 
>> Thank you for that. Go ahead. 
>> And to follow up on, I think 

[10:30:46 AM]

that theme, um, speaking as a surgeon, um, who takes care of patients, um, one of the important things that you raised comes from rich Mccormick is the issue of standards. And as a surgeon, one of the premier quality programs started in the va system with the va surgical improvement program, which has become the national surgical improvement program across the country through the American college of surgeons. So I think the fundamental question that we are asking as researchers and as clinicians delivering that care is, are our patients receiving the same quality of care, the same standard of care that the va has spent generations? So the work of this committee and with the va to invest in a high standard of care, um, are we sacrificing the quality, uh, for convenience? Um, and the other part of the standard is the academic vision of the va, which keeps the va at the cutting edge of research and teaching and more importantly, really focuses on the core mission driven purpose of healthcare, serving the patients, educating the future so they can continue to serve 

[10:31:47 AM]

veterans. So I think maintaining that mission and seeing if they received the comparable care academically, innovation wise, quality, um, is a driving focus. Uh, our research. 
>> Go ahead. 
>> Is there a. 
>> Policy that you would recommend that we could implement to make sure we're driving that standard? Because there seems to be so many regulations out there, and somehow they're evading and finding a way for it to dip. So what would you recommend so we can keep that quality? 
>> Um, so we looked into this question, um, as more and more veterans receive care in the community, um, you know, there is existing quality programs in the community through medicare that is subject to federal regulation, um, and transparency. So we asked that question in the paper is published in health affairs in January this year and asked the question, what's the quality of the care that veterans are receiving when they receive community care versus direct care in the va? What we found was that we grouped, um, physicians in the community into four groups low, low, um, 

[10:32:48 AM]

four quartiles, we call it um, and what we found was that, um, veterans were more likely to see physicians in the lowest quartile or lowest category of performance. So those physicians were 9% more likely to take care of veterans than the highest, uh, quality group of physicians. That's specifically pronounced for primary care and mental health care, which are the services that our veterans need the most, where the veterans were 12% more likely to see a lower performing, uh, group of physicians and for mental health, but a 9% higher likelihood of seeing the, um, the lower performing group of physicians. So I think there's a an important urgency to make sure that referrals, as congressman Takano mentioned, um, that are, uh, administered by third party administrators, optum, that they're not being referred preferentially to, um, physicians that are employed by the third party administrators. Um, but they're actually, um, 

[10:33:49 AM]

matching and trying to serve the needs of the, um, of the veterans in their own communities. So there's a opportunities, I think, for collaboration, for synergy, as more of our veterans receive care outside the va system, in the, uh, both the private and the public, um, part of the healthcare system through medicare, of aligning our quality improvement programs to make sure that we're, um, that a rising tide truly floats all boats, not just for medicare patients, but also for veterans receiving care, uh, and physicians who are being incentivized by the medicare program. 
>> Mark. 
>> Go ahead. 
>> So, um, so for these third party administrators and you're saying the preponderance of veterans are going into the lower quartile of care? Um, is that because so they, you know, these third party administrators have to find places and make a contract between the two, so forth and so on. So is it because it's easier for them to find the lower quartile because they need the business versus the 

[10:34:51 AM]

higher care facilities that they may not have a contract with and couldn't refer them anyway. 
>> Yeah, I feel like I'm at a graduate research seminar right now. You're asking the really important questions. So it's absolutely true that, um, the veterans, um, who are most under are served are from areas of rural communities. Um, we looked at, um, a measurement of the, uh, the community need called the social deprivation index and measures some of the, um, social demographics, socioeconomic variables that contribute to the social determinants of health. Um, so on, without controlling for those factors, um, the, um, access to higher quality physicians, higher performing physicians in the medicare mips program was lower in those areas. So we directly accounted for those in our analyzes. So we controlled for both the region. The veterans are from from the region, the community care network, um, as well as the um, urban versus rural um area, as well as the zip code 

[10:35:52 AM]

level, um, social deprivation of the physician serve that area. That mitigated some of the effect that we saw. But despite that, we still saw that 9%, um, higher likelihood of seeing a lower performing physician within an area that is rural that has comparable levels of social deprivation. 
>> I think this is a pretty significant finding, as according to us, um, because the whole, uh, discussion around, uh, community care and why it's better for rural veterans is being contradicted by what he's saying. 
>> Did you look at both optum and triwest? 
>> So we looked at the entirety of all the physicians who were receiving a claim. When we looked at across all five regions, our, um, created by networks, by both optum and triwest, we have ongoing research to try to map out the physician ownership to see if their optum or um, or triwest affiliate, although, you know, it is very opaque. So I think 

[10:36:52 AM]

there's another important point is that there's need. We talked a lot about the transparency of ownership for hospitals, but it's that same urgency exists, uh, on the ownership of physician practices, especially in this area of vertical integration where health plans are owning hospitals. Hospitals are becoming healthcare systems, health systems are owning practices. The lines become increasingly blurred. And I think for us to have, um, be effective, um, uh, generating research, having the transparency of that ownership is incredibly important. My colleagues at brown have been really leading the way in identifying those patterns of ownership. I think, um, a lot of, uh, there's been a lot of federal and state focus on the hospital ownership. I think there's equal importance on the, um, on the ownership of the practices and some of the other facilities, ambulatory surgical centers, urgent care centers, um, that are actually the front doors of how the patients and veterans access care. 
>> Do you have any bifurcated data on women versus men veterans? I've done a lot of work for women veterans and their access to health care. So women veterans have to get a 

[10:37:53 AM]

lot of their health care outside the va in the community. So they're dependent, uh, you know, on these systems. So I'm just wondering, uh, you know, are women the preponderance of our women veterans seeking health care are getting the lowest health care. 
>> We had that data areas. I don't have that information handy, but I want to, you know, make sure if there's a reliable expertise of others on the table, people have that information or data. Yeah. But that that's something we would love to follow up on to, to take a look because I think that's. 
>> That's this is the interplay here. Is that the the research is out there. Uh, these kinds of questions will come up. And, uh, so I know you're going to take that out and, um, take Mr. Brownlee's curiosity. Uh, it's a very important question. Um, you know, there's two things I want to say before I recognize as a doctor. Myers. Um, uh, is one the, um, the oversight, uh, 

[10:38:54 AM]

both over community care and our third party administrators, both from the what the va does is oversight and what this committee does. Oversight, I think, is a huge, um, missing piece. Um, the second thing is the frustration that I experienced during the pandemic. We had some notable veterans home state veterans homes, which are not the same as the community veteran homes, but the state veterans homes in new Jersey and Massachusetts, um, other parts of Hawaii. Um, but also we have veterans that were in, uh, community, uh, nursing homes, uh, even though va, the only thing that va could do to have any kind of accountability is just to cut the funding. Um, we did not have the ability to really go and inspect on an at will basis, uh, to hold the state veterans homes accountable or, uh, the the 

[10:39:55 AM]

community home is available where veterans were being paid for with va funds. And I think that's that's a big missing piece. Uh, Sheila, the regulation notably that the Obama administration tried to put into place before the pandemic, not an oppressive way, but it was to mandate that nursing homes generally would have a infection control doctor. Uh, that was to be everyone had to have an infection control doctor that the first few months of the first trump administration relaxed that particular rule, I think, to disastrous effect, because the, uh, the mortality rate, uh, covid mortality rate was principally in nursing homes that had no infection control expertise. And where was that expertise often was in va, and there was a cumbersome process to get va to be able to go into those homes. So, uh, doctor Myers, go ahead. 
>> I just wanted to add briefly 

[10:40:56 AM]

to, uh, doctor size comments about this issue of sort of optum as a third party administrator and optum owned practices. So doctor Singh and I have actually done some work that's coming up forthcoming, looking at what happens when optum acquires a practice and how does that change sort of care patterns. And what we tend to see is that there's no real differences in the outcomes that patients experience. But the coding intensity increases by about 30%, and so they capture much more codes. And I think it's an open question to what extent optum, as a third party administrator of va community care, is preferentially guiding, uh, their veterans to optum practices. I think that's not something that that we have the data on yet and that we understand yet. But to the extent that as a single vertically integrated entity, they have the ability to do that, it does raise pretty significant payment concerns that if they guide veterans to these practices, and these practices are very good at upcoding issues, then that could raise larger sort of cost of care concerns for, um, for the community care program. 

[10:41:57 AM]

>> Well, I'm glad you have the data. I want to move on. We need to move this on. Doctor Gupta, thank you for, uh, for for opening this part of the discussion. I would like to move to, uh, senator cappelletti, um, I want to thank you for coming down from Philadelphia to join us today. You have firsthand experience legislating on these issues after witnessing the significant harmful effects of predatory, for profit driven decision making by private equity companies in healthcare in your very own community. Can you tell us about the events that led to your push on for profit healthcare reform in Pennsylvania state and Pennsylvania state senate, and how you approach tackling this issue through legislation, whether you whether you found any bipartisanship among your colleagues? 
>> Well. 
>> Thank you, ranking member Takano, for including me and what's happening in Pennsylvania at this roundtable. I'm really proud to be here today on behalf of pennsylvanians and Americans all across the country who believe access to quality healthcare is one of the most essential pillars of a just and 

[10:42:59 AM]

thriving society. And I also want to note that doctor Singh's comments about private equity and the difference of private equity and for profit really hits at the heart of what happened in my community in Pennsylvania. So I appreciate reduced services and diminished access to care, most especially in underserved communities and rural communities in Pennsylvania. As I've noted, I saw these these consequences firsthand. In 2016, prospect medical holdings, a private equity firm, acquired our crosier health care system and converted it to a for profit enterprise. Shortly after the acquisition, prospect sold off crosier's real estate assets and then leased them back. As 

[10:44:01 AM]

mentioned, a financial maneuver that saddled the health care system with approximately $34 million in annual rent obligations across its hospitals. This heavy financial burden triggered a domino effect of service cuts. Critical units were shut down, starting with maternity wards and emergency care services, followed by the closure of entire hospitals or their conversions into so-called micro-hospitals, which offer extremely limited care. These outcomes culminated in prospect declaring bankruptcy recently, leaving communities without the comprehensive health care services that they've depended on for generations. By may 2025, despite the efforts from the state, health care stakeholders and community members, all available options to keep the crosier healthcare system open had been exhausted and ultimately crosier was closed. With this closure, hundreds of thousands of Delaware county residents, which is just outside of Philadelphia county, 

[10:45:01 AM]

are now stranded without access to local medical care, and many now up to an hour away from emergency rooms. And thousands of residents of southeastern Pennsylvania are now without jobs. While the closure of the closure of the crosier health system was a high profile, devastating example of private equity's ability and outright willingness to destroy local healthcare systems, this is only one example of a disturbing pattern we are seeing nationwide, and in Pennsylvania, we have similar reductions to care underway at tower health network at Sharon regional medical center in very rural mercer county, Pennsylvania, and in my own district just outside of Philadelphia. With prime healthcare's recent conversion of suburban community hospital in a low income community. Turning that into a micro hospital. And while private equity companies rake in hundreds of millions of dollars dollars from hospital closures, hundreds of thousands of pennsylvanians are left without critical health care services. And I find that deeply unacceptable. These experiences 

[10:46:03 AM]

led me, democratic colleagues and me in the senate and the house to look for legislative solutions to safeguard Pennsylvania's communities from the harm of that private equity has posed to our neighbors. Access to care. The legislative package that we introduced is in direct response to the for profit financial abuse of hospital and health systems, and thanks to one sided private equity deals that are allowed to happen in Pennsylvania, staples of our legislative package include preventing for profit entities from owning or managing a hospital or health system in Pennsylvania, creating oversight through the office of the attorney general, and setting minimum standards regarding notification and severance payoffs for severance payments for mass layoffs. Of this three bill package, we've only seen one of those bills move, and that was the house version of our bill. And it's house bill 1460. It was passed by a democratic majority in Pennsylvania state house. This bill would provide the attorney general's office with the tools needed to ensure qualified, experienced and competent operators committed to 

[10:47:03 AM]

providing immediate access to good quality care are acting in good faith as they enter Pennsylvania's healthcare marketplace. And it had notable bipartisan support, with 20 Republicans joining all but one of the Democrats in the chamber to pass the bill. Unfortunately, my Republican colleagues who control the senate in Pennsylvania have shown no will to move this vital piece of legislation forward so it could become law. Pennsylvania senate Democrats like me, who are supporting this initiative, along with stakeholders invested in seeing this legislative package become law. And our governor. We are all continuing to look for ways to move these bills forward, because we know that if they become law, we will have the tools to prevent needed to prevent more hospital closures and ensure pennsylvanians can access the critical care that they not only need, but have every right to receive. Because a healthcare system that prioritizes patients over the interests of private equity is the foundation of a healthy community. And I'm going to do everything in my power to make 

[10:48:04 AM]

healthy communities the reality for every pennsylvanian. And I thank this committee for making sure that we are working towards that reality for every veteran as well. 
>> Thank you so much for that. Senator. Congratulations on the bipartisan work that you did in the Pennsylvania house. Um, I if you would, I'd like to move next to, um, uh, Mr. Noble, um, your organization has methodically documented private equity penetration. We just had one of your your your Pennsylvania state senate members talk about the work that you did in the house. We're joined by Chris Deluzio, um, from Pennsylvania, from Pennsylvania. Other side of the state. Steelers. Steelers. Well, back to Mr. Noble. Uh, your organization has methodically documented private equity penetration into numerous industries, including healthcare. In your view, what 

[10:49:04 AM]

additional data points would be helpful for us to look at, uh, to fully understand how veterans are, how veterans are being impacted by private equity's growing ownership stake in healthcare. 
>> Thank you. Member. Closer now. Okay. Uh, thank you so much for having me. Um, yeah. So in thinking about this question and hearing, um, you know, folks on the esteemed panel talk, um, opacity, opacity is, um, a major problem, uh, when you're looking at private equity ownership of healthcare entities and, um, you know, I, we have mostly looked at, um, hospitals, um, nursing homes, the medicare context. Um, but I'm sure there are some parallels. Um, you know, if you're actually to, you know, be able to find out who these providers are and there have been difficulties getting that list. Um, but I do think that CMS actually might be some inspiration for this. A couple of years ago, um, they did finalize that rule about nursing home transparency. Um, but also and I'm pulling this 

[10:50:05 AM]

up right now on the medicare enrollment application. Um, it requires, you know, all entities that are taking medicare dollars want to be part of the program to disclose certain ownership or ownership relationships, includes management, management, service organizations. Um, you know, if you have a change of control and, you know, ownership is not or control does not just mean ownership, it could mean controlling the board of directors or having a seat. And so, um, these are the data points. I think, you know, my colleagues do painstaking research where we look at, um, you know, um, was it pitchbook data and, um, hospital lists from CMS and sort of cross list and cross-reference? Um, it seems that this information can be collected, um, you know, either at the point of application, um, or some ongoing monitoring. Um, you know, there is, I think, ongoing monitoring, um, with the nursing homes, uh, and, and updating the change, any change of ownership, uh, those types of safeguards and accountability, um, in my opinion, could be applied when, 

[10:51:05 AM]

you know, it's okay. A third party administrator needs is or a providers trying to apply with the third party administrator. Okay. What is your application look like? Um, you know, are there any opportunities to include these disclosures in there? And so, um, I think simple ownership, I know it's sort of a simple answer to a complex question, but ownership information, that's really sort of where we're starting at. We don't have the basics. So I think that's um, that's important. 
>> Well, just from the list, laundry list of things you gave. So I'll opacity. Um, but there seems to be like a breakdown in the, in the rules of how competition is supposed to work. Uh, this vertical integration, it's all about a monopolistic, uh, sort of behavior. Um, and it's, um, my colleague Chris Deluzio and I have joined forces in this, uh, we call it. What do we call that? We call it the monopoly busting. The monopoly busters caucus. Um, it's really this corruption of. 

[10:52:06 AM]

It's a corruption of capitalism itself. I think it's part it's part of the problem. It's that's what causes it to be perverse. And so when people are able to own elements, uh, and profit off of this integration of all the different parts, uh, of, uh, you know, the supply chain or the, the labor chain or be able to so and part of it's the regulation of it just, uh, they shouldn't be able to cut nursing staff, uh, to a certain level. Um, that's not how they should be able to compete with each other. They should be able to. So we should set the parameters. The, the our job is to set the rules. I know we're going to get into model legislation in a moment. Uh, but, uh, anyway, you got me thinking about all these things as you were talking, so I want to now we have a thank you. Uh, is it miss brown? Yes. Go ahead. Aaron brown. Yeah. 
>> So just wanted to pick up on before we get into the the legislation that we the variety of policy approaches I wanted to pick up on this opacity, this this lack of understanding 

[10:53:08 AM]

at the very basics. Who owns your hospital? Who owns your nursing home? Who owns your doctor's office there? The researchers have to use painstaking, proprietary data sources to come up with incomplete information on this. And it is really standing in the way. So at the very least, everything is built on, you know, putting some transparency. And they're not just of the ownership structures, but increasingly also of the related party transactions that that gets. At your second point about this, these sort of conglomerates, these vertical stacks where you see a lot of entities, not only private equity owned, but other types of chain owners that are impoverishing the facilities by through these real estate investment trusts, sale leaseback arrangements in a way that makes the owner money, right. The owner gets the related party earnings. Um, but they don't they it makes the nursing home or the facility poorer and poorer. And it which causes staffing cuts and the nursing homes use that as the 

[10:54:09 AM]

reason to resist successfully the nursing home minimum staffing requirements. The rule that was overturned in court because they said this is economically unreasonable. We can't do this. We're so we're so impoverished. Well, they're impoverished because of these tactics. And without both ownership information as well as information on how that these profits and assets are moved out of the system, out of the entity and into the into these related party transactions. We really need transparency, not just of the ownership structures, but of the movement of money and flow of funds among these entities. 
>> Wow, thank you so much for that. How we kind of miss Brownlee. Go ahead. 
>> Just a follow up question. So on this ownership issue, um, it seems like a very important piece of information that we should know. And, um, so do we have any sense, um, of what percentage of, you know, private equity, um, private 

[10:55:12 AM]

equity, uh, facilities, whether they're hospitals, nursing homes or percentage of the overall health care facilities. Do we have any is it. It sounds like it's a growing percentage, but. 
>> There we go. Um, so the short answer is there are imperfect estimates. Um, researchers have estimated about 5% of nursing homes, 10% of hospitals, and in the ballpark of 20% of physicians, depending on the specialty, are currently affiliated with private equity firms. That is a short answer because of the issues we've been discussing related to ownership and disclosure. These are all extreme underestimates. And so one issue that arises thanks to the lack of transparency, is we can't agree on the magnitude of the problem, because depending on the data I have and folks across the table might have will come up with very different estimates. 
>> Is there any way for government to, um, you know, check whether if we're asking 

[10:56:13 AM]

for the information for them to check the information to make sure that it's accurate? It sounds it seems as though there's an incentive here not to be, to give as little information as possible. 
>> That raises a real concern, I think, with some of the, um, ownership requirements. Um, I'll leave it to my colleague Aaron to talk about where we've done some work, specifically incorporating aspects of this into model legislation, where there's requirements to report, but then also enforcement mechanisms to verify the accuracy of what's being reported. But it's a real issue, because I think at the crux of the issue is these are private investments by nature, by definition. And if you don't agree on what we're dealing with, is this a 1% problem or a 21% problem or an 81% problem, it's difficult to have a conversation around what can be done to improve the status quo. 
>> And I think just on the the best example, as um, Mr. Noble mentioned, is the nursing home ownership transparency rule. And even there there's incomplete reporting and there and the reporting that has been, 

[10:57:14 AM]

um, produced on nursing home ownership structures has been incomplete and inaccurate at best. And part of that is because the information that's reported on the CMS. 855 a enrollment form. One, it's not very timely. It only has to be done sort of upon revalidation. So that can be up to a five year lag. If there's no change of ownership. There's also no incentive to comply because, um, if you submit faulty information or it's not complete or you just simply don't bother to submit your information, um, there's no auditing power by the, by the agency. And the only penalty is to, to basically kick the nursing home out of the medicare and medicaid program. Um, and that is no, no one really wants to do that because that will be very disruptive. And so without sort of intermediate sanctions or other penalties, um, there's fraud and abuse, false claims act liability for, you know, not disclosing your related party payments on your cost reports. But as far as the nursing home ownership transparency rule, there's very little sort of 

[10:58:14 AM]

discretionary penalties that can be applied to encourage compliance. Um, and so as a result, even where you have the sort of leading rule, I know, you, um, um, ranking member Takano cosponsored a bill, the link act, to improve the the nursing home ownership transparency rules. Um, we have to think about sort of enforcement auditing, but as well as the timing of these disclosures to make sure that there actually is compliance. 
>> Thank you very, uh. 
>> Quick, um, piggyback on that. Is that, um, I think part and parcel with lack of transparency is lack of accountability, as um, folks have pointed out. And when we talk about medicare fraud, um, we talk about antitrust, you know, these lawsuits that we've seen over the years where the, um, the company, you know, is a party or the parent company might be a party but then ends up getting dismissed. Um, we've just talked about how these financial incentives push portfolio companies, um, you know, healthcare companies to do certain things. And so at 

[10:59:15 AM]

the very least, um, you know, I would say a rebuttable presumption that the private equity firm has something to do with some of the bad behavior, um, that's the subject of a lawsuit should be considered, and they shouldn't be so easily able to escape accountability just because it's a limited, you know, liability situation. 
>> Okay. Um, I'm going to call doctor sai, but I want to get to the the false claims folks. So we're going to call on you. So go ahead, doctor sai. 
>> It's just a follow up on that. And I it was great to hear about the approach in in Pennsylvania to share a little bit about the experience from Massachusetts, where, um, it was we almost hopefully the rest of the country can learn from the consequences. What's happened in our own, uh, commonwealth as well, uh, with the consequences of the steward health care system. Uh, we summarize the Massachusetts model recently in a perspective piece in the new England journal of medicine. It was passed as a house bill 5159, which is now signed by our governor earlier this year, where we have stricter requirements of reporting for 

[11:00:15 AM]

transparency, ownership, over 10%, actually a fine of I believe, if I remember correctly, it's about $25,000 per day when, um, uh, providers are out of compliance with that reporting requirement. When we argue about if that's the right size, at least is putting, um, teeth and enforcement into this very important matter. And we talked about the real estate investment trusts, um, work that, um, uh, doctor Busch and I have done is, uh, shown the increasing growth of the presence of real estate investment trusts as a way for the private equity firms to extract profit from the health care providers. But for hospitals and increasing growth in the, um, nursing home industries, um, as well. And in Massachusetts, um, as a again, a blowback from the consequences of Stewart healthcare's collapse, um, there's essentially a moratorium on any new licensing by the state public health department for any hospital that's owned by real estate investment trust. So I'm excited, as a researcher, as a clinician, taking care of 

[11:01:16 AM]

patients to see a lot of the different, um, models that states are experimenting. Um, I think there may be different approaches based off of the, the types of providers, the degree of consolidation and different markets, I think, across different states. Um, but um, but as a researcher and as a clinician, um, the hope is that, um, it's not too little, too late. That's important to prevent the consequence of this, both for our community providers, but also especially for the veterans who are increasingly seeking their care outside of the va system. 
>> Thank you. Doctor. Uh, I want to now turn to, uh, miss kovalski and Mr. Oh, Mr. Go ahead. I'm sorry. 
>> No. Thank you. Um, I'm really glad senator cappelletti is here talking about the approach in Pennsylvania, which I would love to see more states. Do. I know we're not alone in this? And it it tees up for for us. I think when we have gavels, we can pass laws, uh, doing something about community care providers who are owned by private equity. And I know 

[11:02:16 AM]

we're on defense around privatization, but when we are able to pass an anti privatization bill, which I think we should and we have control of things here, uh, we should just be as blunt and direct as some of these efforts in the states. And I think that's where we got to go when we, when we can actually get something like that signed by a president. 
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Lazio. Um, uh, so I would like to, uh, move to Mr. Kang and miss Kowalski. Miss Kowalski, you have successfully litigated a false claims act lawsuit against a private equity firm that knowingly owned a company that was operating a pill mill and defrauding the government. Um, miss Demar, um, you, uh, your work at the anti fraud coalition helps protect and empower whistleblowers who expose fraud. I'd like you all to speak a bit about the false claims act cases you have been involved with. Uh, and how we should think about scrutinizing private equity through oversight in the veteran space. 

[11:03:17 AM]

So, uh, miss Kowalski and Mr. Mr. Kang, go ahead. 
>> Thank you, ranking member Takano. And thank you for inviting us all to be here. And for this, um, very useful discussion. So the purpose of the false claims act, which is an old law it's been around since the civil war, is to return money to the fisc. So the false claims act is coming in after some of this misconduct has already happened. But I think it can be a powerful tool to prevent it. If private equity companies are seeing large verdicts or large settlements, I think it can certainly serve as a disincentive, and there's ways that it can do that better. So to to put it simply, if anybody is unfamiliar, the false claims act, um, acts to punish the defendants for claims that the government paid out through programs like medicare or tricare, that it wouldn't have paid, but for the defendant's misconduct, to put it simply, um, and one of the issues with private equity is the tension that exists. I know doctor Singh talked about how private 

[11:04:19 AM]

equity, the goal is to make a quick exit, usually 3 to 5 years, sometimes seven. Um, that is directly at tension with how long these cases take. So the statute provides for a 60 day period under which the case is filed, and the government has a period to do an investigation. But in practice, what actually happens is that investigation can take many, many years. I have a case right now from 2017. Um, we can't talk about names because it is still under seal, but that is a private equity owned defendant. And the problem with that is when private equity exits during these investigations, there isn't a pot of money that you would have access to. That money has been disbursed already to the investors. So you have to be able to bring in the individuals. And that's what we did in the case. I believe you're referring to the case. And in some cases that can be easier than others. It's easier in cases where it's really closely held. That portfolio company already had significant 

[11:05:21 AM]

problems. And the director, the managers of the um, LLC, the private equity firm, were very brazenly engaged in misconduct. That was an off label case relating to a fentanyl drug. So it was a an easier example of where you could bring in the individuals. But I know that there was a push after the Yates memo came out, and I believe it was 2017. There was a lot of talk about how you would expect to see more private equity firms being held accountable. And I know Jackie will probably relate to this, but when we go meet with U.S. Attorney's offices, they often tell us it's still a top priority. But the reality is you're not seeing enough of it. And it's it's largely because of this tension. And I know that there are some newer judges that are denying seal extensions quickly. Um, but but the reality is, I think something needs to be done, you know, through the way of the statute and practice that can quicken up these investigations so that private equity can, um, really be fully held 

[11:06:22 AM]

accountable. You know, if it's taking seven, sometimes ten years, it's just that that ship might've already sailed. Um, but for the individuals to be named, that's certainly, um, we have a passion for not only health care fraud, but the private equity role in it. Um, we always look for individual liability. Um, one, because I think that they should be held liable for the same reason. Um, you know, when you're dealing with, like, corporate, um, corporations, the individuals behind that, you know, the sacklers, people like that they should be held accountable to, um, we always look for that. And it is often the only way you can collect, too, because like I said, the money from the fund is already dispersed. So I think for us to make full use of the false claims act, um, which I know that this administration has said that, you know, it is I think they're using it in different ways, but it is something that they have talked about, um, which is encouraging to us. So maybe there's a way to, um, work together to, you know, strengthen the false claims, act in that way so that these 

[11:07:23 AM]

investigations don't take so long. 
>> Um. Is it Mr. Maher? Um. 
>> Thank you again for having me. Um, so our organization does focus on whistleblower laws and promoting whistleblowers. Um, and one thing that you mentioned a lot today is opacity in these situations, and that is a cure that the whistleblowers can bring somebody inside that really knows what the structure is like and can come forward and bring those facts to light. Um, Candace was mentioning how long these investigations take, and I think that you can tell by looking at the amount of cases that are out there right now involving private equity firms. Um, that there's there there are settlements, but there's not a ton of them. I think that is, um, because many, many of them are still remaining under seal. Um, and you'll see a big wave of these things coming forward. Um, and also the I don't think these investigations are going to move any faster right now because staffing at doj is so, so low. It is troubling. Um, 

[11:08:24 AM]

and so I think if there's any way to get more resources for the department of justice to investigate these cases, that would really help to speed this up. Um, there are about, you know, 4 or 5 settlements out there. But again, I believe there are many, many under seal still, because private equity is really treating this like any other investment, instead of really focusing on the fact that this is this involves real patients, um, real medicare dollars, that's taxpayer dollars. And so they're going to be more people coming forward, um, as, as the private equity industry increases here. Um, we've been discussing that there are a lot of regulations out there, but, you know, there's not accountability. There can be under the false claims act. Um, if we use the the law the way that it should be used and, um, you know, there's the false claims act has brought in in $78 billion back to the taxpayers. Um, and, you know, the majority of that, at least 60% has been healthcare. So, um, there's a huge, huge pool of money that needs to be brought back. 

[11:09:25 AM]

There's the whistleblowers coming forward. Really care about patient care. Um, that's usually why why they are coming forward. So, um, I think that there's kind of going to be a boom here in, in this area, but an increase in the speed of these cases will definitely help that if that's at all possible. 
>> Well thank you. Um, let me, uh, why don't we move on to thank you. Thank you all for the false claims act. And I'm wondering if, uh, some of the members here, we might, um, write a letter to doj about the staffing challenges. Um, if we're looking for government efficiency and return on rooting out fraud, waste and abuse, I think we've we've hit a pretty big vein here. And, um, uh, it could redirect doge, um, into into things like this. There could be a, you know, I would hazard a guess what that amount of money would be. Um, 

[11:10:27 AM]

uh, let us, um, now move to, uh, Mr. Garber, I was it miss. Miss Garber, my eyes are playing tricks on miss Garber. I hope that you can tell us about, um, the loan. The loan institute's view on what social responsibility is for hospitals and how private equity hospitals have performed in terms of social responsibility. How should we, as policymakers respond? 
>> Absolutely, absolutely. So, um, the hospitals index for social responsibility, um, was developed starting we launched starting in 2020. There's a lot of hospital rankings out there. We, uh, strive to be a bit different. We have you know, we believe that socially responsible hospitals have to take care of their patients, you know, first and foremost with good outcomes, uh, keeping them, uh, out of the hospital and, uh, good, more, uh, low mortality rates, good patient safety. But then also to have good value in terms of, uh, you know, monetary value, um, we 

[11:11:27 AM]

measure cost efficiency, which looks at medicare spending, um, for two hospitals with the same mortality rate, which hospital has a less risk adjusted medicare spending and then also avoiding, um, overuse or unnecessary care, certain low value procedures that don't provide no clinical benefit, but still, you know, put the patient at risk of harm and, you know, waste money. We also look at some measures of health equity, because we think that it's very important that a socially responsible hospital is caring for everyone in their community. Um, providing enough, um, financial assistance, uh, doing well to serve medicaid patients as well, um, and paying their workers fairly. So we took a little look at some of the private equity owned or, uh, private equity, uh, either form recently owned or currently owned hospitals. And it's sort of a snapshot in time of these systems. And what we found was they don't do very well on outcomes for the most part, uh, fairly low, um, 

[11:12:30 AM]

grades on our outcomes measures and almost, I think, across the board, pretty poor on value, which is interesting because I think some of the, uh, justification for private equity involvement here is efficiency, but we're not really seeing that on our, on our metrics. Um, and that also kind of, uh, corresponds to some reports about, uh, physician offices, um, owned by private equity that do unnecessary procedures at a higher rate. Um, but then in terms of the health equity metrics, we see something interesting, which is that they do they do. Okay. And we weren't really expecting to see them doing so well. And I think what that after we thought about it for a while, what that says to us, um, those metrics that we look at are often a function of the communities they're serving and where they're located. And so what this is saying to us is that there are there are, um, hospitals in some areas that have poor patients, more medicaid patients, maybe they're serving more patients from communities of color. And 

[11:13:30 AM]

these hospitals are not very profitable in the system we have right now. So you would be less likely to see maybe a nonprofit system scoop them up, or they're struggling, maybe because they're not making money on patient care. Um, but maybe there's a chance for them to there might be an opportunity a private equity firm could see to own them, to kind of suck out any remaining funds there are in the real estate, for example, or in cutting staff, which a nonprofit system probably wouldn't do. Uh, and, you know, that's what we see a bit in for the steward system in Massachusetts that that went bankrupt was that, you know, a lot of those hospitals were safety net hospitals. So we're seeing this from a real health equity point of view. This is an important issue. I know that's kind of a dirty word these days to to say that, but we still think it's really important. Land institute I'm sure, like many of you agree, that. 
>> I think. 
>> Everyone deserves. Yes. Good eye. Yes. I'm really glad to hear that. Um, so in terms of, you know, what we all should do, I think we we've heard a bunch of, uh, great, um, uh, things 

[11:14:30 AM]

already. And the way I see it for veterans care is sort of three things you could do. You could insulate veterans from this entirely by resisting privatization of va healthcare. Um, you could also, uh, tackle sort of what makes private equity. So, um, concerning in that, uh, something that doctor brown referred to in terms of the fact that all of the liability, all the debt is on the firm that's being acquired, their proposals to establish joint liability so that that the private equity firm has skin in the game as well, um, delaying dividend payouts for a period of time. Um, and is making it so that they can't use, uh, can't have that capital gains special tax rate for a period of time as well. All these would make it less enticing for private equity firms to come swoop in. Um, but as doctor brush was saying, I think it's really important that the reason that they're in there is because there's, uh, there's some bad incentives 

[11:15:31 AM]

within the health system more generally. And you're seeing, uh, high consolidation across the board, even not including private equity. So addressing these issues in terms of, um, health care consolidation across the board, also addressing, you know, what I was talking about, where it's really, really hard to be a safety net hospital. Uh, we, we actually see like there is a negative relationship between the, um, safety net hospitals that serve more patients from communities of color and how good outcomes they're able to do. We see a few really great exceptions that are providing this, like super high quality of care for for everyone and especially for those communities. But, um, it's it's incredibly hard for safety net hospitals to be able to have, um, enough margin to be able to invest in that. So that's a huge problem that, um, it's important to make sure that all hospitals have adequate reimbursement. And ideally, we'd be paying hospitals the same for every patient, regardless of their insurer. 

[11:16:31 AM]

Thanks. 
>> Thank you. Thank you, miss Garber. Um, I'm. I'm. You don't have to answer. No one has to answer this quite yet. But I'm curious about public university owned healthcare systems. Um, those that own their own hospitals, just how they the outcomes with public universities like the university of California, San Diego, university of California, Irvine, UCLA, they own hospitals. I hope they still own their hospitals. I mean, all this lack of opacity has me very nervous. So it's like, uh, um, and I have a university, um, hospital, medical school, university of California, Riverside. Um, but I don't have enough, um, hospitals and, uh, so, but everywhere I go in California, if I go in San Diego, I'll see ucsd medical. They, they kind of, um, grow. And so the same thing in Irvine, um, but the backing of the of 

[11:17:31 AM]

the people of California, it seems to me probably a good thing, but I, I'd like to kind of know what the actual data shows. Um, I'm going to call on doctor Bruce. Uh, and then I saw a senator raise her hand. I'm going to call on her. But then I really want to hear from the brown folks and their model legislation, because that will help people like miss Brownlee and I to really get to work. Uh, if we have, like, a, you know, some, some model to sort of rely on. So doctor Bruce, go ahead. 
>> Thank you. Yes. Let me respond to, um, your question. One of the interesting things about financialization is that, yes, it refers to how financial firms and financial actors are acquiring and operating our healthcare entities, but really important, and I think we haven't really discussed this yet, is how healthcare organizations themselves have become financialized. So it includes, uh, nonprofit hospitals, even academic hospitals. How have they increasingly mirrored the motives of financial actors and the logics of financial actors? 

[11:18:32 AM]

So if we're thinking about, you know, visibility and even health hospital rankings, we should think about, well, what does it mean that our nonprofit health systems are increasingly relying on revenue cycle management vendors that are private equity owned? What does it mean that our nonprofit hospitals are increasingly staffing to private equity emergency department staffing companies? And what does it mean that our nonprofit hospitals themselves are increasingly investing in private equity, even having venture capital arms? It's not just private equity acquisitions of healthcare, uh, entities. It's nonprofits themselves that have embedded themselves in the financial sector and are increasingly relying on financial actors for healthcare delivery. This obviously raises really critical, you know, policy implications because it's great and there's no doubt we need better transparency, but we 

[11:19:33 AM]

will be very limited if that transparency only is about ownership and not what's happening in other entities that aren't, say, private equity owns. Thank you. 
>> Well, you started to say things I was afraid you were going to say. The nonprofits and they're they're doing the same. Alright. Go ahead, senator. 
>> I was going to kind of talk a little bit about the nonprofit sector as well, when it comes to healthcare, and I'm taking off my senator hat a little bit here and putting more of my mph hat and talking about what's happening with them and reimbursement rates. And we talk about how important reimbursement rates. Um, there was a little bit of a blow up during our appropriations hearing for the department of human services and the department of health, because one of my colleagues across the aisle was very upset that there was a focus on, um, the black maternal maternal mortality and his, uh, his labor and delivery ward at the one hospital and his very large, sparsely populated district, um, was closing, really leaving him and 

[11:20:35 AM]

his community with with. No. And the real root of that issue is that reimbursement rates. But then also thinking about the financialization and what's happening, I'm seeing in Pennsylvania, where I'm at in the southeast, there are several major healthcare systems, and even some of the better ones, uh, are being bought out by some of the other ones. And it's all nonprofit buyouts right now that are happening. And you're seeing kind of the sprawling access of care for one health care system. And on the other side of the state, congressman Deluzio is no longer here, but he would agree. There's also one side of the state that's largely accessible by one healthcare system that happens to be university owned and and worked through. So I think as we're continuing to think about what does delivery of care look like, private equity is, you know, the immediate piece that's happening right now because we are watching that, um, the impacts of that destroy our health care systems and close hospitals and impact our nursing homes. All of these different pieces are there. But I do think we would be remiss 

[11:21:35 AM]

not to think about the broader impacts of who owns healthcare systems and what is happening and who who owns as as doctor brooks said, who, who owns those other pieces, the the the doctors groups who are providing care, all of those other pieces. And how does that play into all of this? Because, um, you know, quality of care can be severely impacted when you only have one healthcare system to go to. And that healthcare system might be a nonprofit. And we're all holding up nonprofits, as you know, and they are wonderful, don't get me wrong. But if they're also tied into private equity in other ways, what does that that cost of care look like and the impact of care look like for our veterans, for our citizens in general. So I just wanted to note that that's really important. 
>> So what we thought was a sheep could be a wolf underneath and, uh, all of that. So, miss Brownlee, go ahead. 
>> Yeah. Just, you know, in terms of everybody knows about the big, beautiful bill and the impacts of that in terms of healthcare. Um, you know, largest cut to health care in 

[11:22:37 AM]

the history of our country. So is this just going to open the door and invite more private equity into the system? Or not? 
>> Just that. And one quick is we know what's happening to medicaid. And if medicaid and the $1 trillion are taken out of the health care system, who is left to pick up the pieces of the providers who are financially struggling, most often in low income communities or communities of color? Uh, and I a lot of us are concerned that that is it is just opening the door much wider. 
>> Yes, I'm going to I'm going to quickly leave, but I want to move toward, uh, the brown people. What what time I have remaining to be able to hear. And then you can continue the discussion. Go ahead. You all can stay. But I want to hear what they have to say and then continue. By the way. Nikki Budzinski, uh, from Illinois is here. So go ahead. Go ahead. 

[11:23:39 AM]

>> Uh, thank you so much. So the model legislation that I think has been referred to I, I believe the, um, I worked with the national academy for state health policy nashby, uh, to help develop what is called their sort of model law on consolidation, corporatization and closures in response to this growing tide and calls from states, um, that are really saying, we need tools. We need tools to combat not just private equity and real estate investment trusts, but also just the growing consolidation of the health care market. Um, and what is this doing to the rest of the accessibility and quality? So there are three parts to this. Uh, again, it's it's sort of state focused. Uh, but it has analogs that could be generalized more broadly to the federal level. There are three aspects to it to deal with the three sort of main concerns that we're, that we've heard about from the research. The first is sort of that consolidation in general, regardless of who is doing the consolidating we know is bad for increasing health care 

[11:24:39 AM]

spending and prices. Um, it is also tending to, uh, create a lack of, uh, danger of lack of access or consolidation of, of provider networks into one giant system. And you need to play ball with them if you want to have access. So consolidation is one piece. Um, the second concern is, uh, the impact this is having on the workforce. So we know that a lot of the the acquisitions, whether it's by private equity or health systems or insurance companies like optum of the physician workforce, is having a demoralizing effect on the workforce. We're hearing a lot of, uh, sense that the clinicians, uh, clinical autonomy and their ability to take care of patients in the way that their professional, um, ethical norms and obligations require of them are being compromised when they're also serving a boss who serves their their shareholders as their profit seeking motives, as their number one duty. So there are ways to insulate the clinicians from having to be 

[11:25:42 AM]

put in this bind, um, to reduce sort of loss of the workforce or the damage to the workforce that happens from corporate consolidation. And then the third piece is the transparency piece that we've talked about today. So the three parts of the bill respond to each of these. The first on the consolidation front is to increase, um, increase oversight and notice and review and authority by the state. And we could imagine an analog happening at the federal level where all transactions, not just outright mergers and acquisitions, but any major material change transaction, um, regardless of whether it involves right now, states have primarily oversight over nonprofit hospital acquisitions. So a lot of states are looking to expand that. To say, if it's even a for profit, um, acquisition, even if it's a real estate investment trust, real estate transaction, if it's a management service organization, um, acquiring control over physician practice, even if it doesn't acquire the physician practice outright, that should all be alerted to, uh, an official that can look over not only the competitive impacts on price in the markets, 

[11:26:42 AM]

but also on the effects on quality, on access, on workforce, um, and all the other things that we care about in our communities. So there's a sort of prior notice, and then the deal can't close until the regulators have had a chance to review the transaction. If it doesn't pose any concerns, it can be allowed to move forward. Um, but if there are concerns, the the oversight entity, whether it's the attorney general's office or the department of health or some other health agency or both would be able to provide detailed review and comprehensive study of the transaction during its pendency. And it can't close until that has happened. Um, and then the the strongest form of this would allow that the, um, the regulators, whether it's the attorney general or the health agency, could block or impose conditions on the transaction before it occurs in order to mitigate some of those impacts. Um, so that is sort of modeled after the, uh, the Massachusetts health policy commission's oversight and cost and market impact review. So that's the first piece. The second piece is the ability to, 

[11:27:43 AM]

um, again, protect the clinicians from the corporate managers. And this luckily, we have many states, most states in the in the country have on their books some form of what is called the corporate practice of medicine doctrine. And this is a law that basically says that corporate non-licensed lay entities cannot own, control or employ physicians. Um, and so what this means is that a lot of physicians, um, have to be owned. The majority or all of the shareholders of a physician practice have to be licensed physicians. Um, however, we know that that corporate entities like private equity, like insurance companies, even hospitals have worked around this for many years by basically just entering into what are called management service, organization agreements with these entities. And so they they manage the practice, they take all the revenue they control. Um, the clinicians may be contractually or through the appointment of a physician who is really on the payroll of the management service organization, um, but who owns all the shares of the physician practice. Um, we 

[11:28:44 AM]

understand that this is having there's less data on this, but this is having a demoralizing effect on the workforce. Yes. Clinicians need the administrative supports to deal with the current modern environment of practicing medicine. And so they're you know, they're looking to these investors, um, they're looking to partner with management service organizations to help them manage the practice. But at the same time, they're turning over the keys to the practice, and they're finding that their ability to see patients for as long as they want or to make the diagnostic decisions that they want, or to be able to schedule their patients and keep certain, um, same day appointments in their schedule. They're they're losing control over these fundamental things that are interfering with the patient physician relationship. So the corporate practice of medicine law that would be strengthened in the model law would target these management service organization agreements and say there are certain things that have to be remain in the control of the clinicians and cannot be done by the mso, the management service organization. And moreover, you can't have someone who is just a physician, a figurehead physician who's not actually in the involved in 

[11:29:45 AM]

the practice, who is really there to just be the the owner of the practice with an MD behind their name? Um, the best example of this we see is the recent passage in Oregon of sb 951, um, a state law that would target the management service organizations and strengthen the corporate practice of medicine to address a lot of these types of strategic arrangements that corporate entities have entered into. Again, to protect clinicians, physician autonomy, professional autonomy. Uh, California also has a pending bill that would do, um, similar, similar things. And then finally, on the ownership transparency, again, taking a page out of Massachusetts registry of provider organizations is to really require that level of transparency, not just for the ownership structure, but also for the finance, the finances to be able to finally answer, who owns your doctor's office? Who owns your nursing home? Who owns your dialysis facility? Um, although we probably know who owns your dialysis facility. Um, 

[11:30:45 AM]

but the but the ability for the state to collect that information. And of course, states are running into they're very interested in learning this information to be able to understand at a very basic minimum, you know, what is the current state of the landscape? Who who owns the the healthcare entities in their, in their, you know, in their state, serving their residents? Um, but another part of it is also, again, tracing those financial implications. And so it's not just upon a transaction when someone is coming in to buy, you know, your health system or a nursing home, but also, um, to, to understand as a current snapshot today of who owns everything in the healthcare system. So that is so those are the three parts to the ownership model law. And there are, as I said, sort of state and federal analogs to each piece of it. No state has thus far undertaken all three parts. Um, but we have been in nashby has been in conversation. We've provided technical assistance to states that are interested in pursuing one or more in a sequential sort of menu like 

[11:31:47 AM]

approach. 
>> What issues like decoding would fall into one of these categories. 
>> So the like the. 
>> Upcoding upcoding. 
>> Yeah. So the upcoding aspect of this. So there's a there are a couple of areas in which upcoding. So there are lots of other tools. Another area is to tackle the financial incentives in the current payment models. Um, whether it's, you know, the medicare advantage payment policy that rewards aggressive diagnostic coding for risk adjusted payments, um, or whether it's, you know, the, the part B, um, physician administered drug payment mechanisms. But so those I would say are ways to target um, the upcoding doesn't feature specifically into the model legislation. Those would be sort of like go out and close those payment loopholes that we understand to be creating financial incentives to basically generate revenue without generating value for the health care system. 
>> I'll add briefly, um, I 

[11:32:47 AM]

believe part two of the model legislation also tackles, uh, the enforceability of non-disclosure terms in physician employment contracts, which would make it easier for whistleblowers to speak up and speak out, um, if they do face financial incentives to upcode and the like. Yeah. 
>> Are there any systems that can catch upcoding? 
>> Yeah. So that's a really good question. And I do a lot of work in the context of upcoding the medicare advantage program, and looking at sort of understanding how that tends to play out. And it is a really difficult, sort of intractable problem, because sometimes when a diagnosis code is captured, you know, we might think it's upcoding, but it could be demonstrated sort of in a patient chart. And so there are some tools you can use, different types of audits. CMS uses the audit to try and go after coding intensity issues. But the challenge is and this is sort of a larger challenge that ties into some of what we've talked about so far, is as there's more financialization and vertical alignment in the health care 

[11:33:48 AM]

system, if optum owns a physician's practice, they control what goes in the medical chart, and the medical charts are. What we're comparing to is the source of truth when we're comparing coding intensity. And so as these arrangements expand, it's going to be even more difficult to really tease out where upcoding exists. The ways that we try to do this is by looking at a population level. So if we look at a group of people who are going to a specific practice or who are enrolled in a specific plan, and if they look a lot sicker than we would expect them to given the other characteristics of people there, or given other sort of metrics of health outcomes like patient reported health status, we can use those to triangulate it. So we know that there's a lot going on, but it ends up being very difficult to sort of legislate around because, um, you know, who's to say that this code isn't, you know, a valid diagnosis. And so I think a lot of the core things go back to what doctor Singh mentioned, that we need to change some of the broader incentives around coding intensity, um, because we can never get rid of all the upcoding itself. 
>> Thank you. I just wanted to 

[11:34:49 AM]

quickly add to the model legislation piece. You know, it sounds great and very comprehensive. One one thing I would recommend considering is, um, you know, think a little bit about aligning the payment incentives, uh, towards quality. So ranking member Takano also mentioned that currently the veterans affairs doesn't really have a way to penalize community care facilities if they do a bad job. CMS has experimented a bit with so-called value based payments, where they either give bonus payments or they give penalties on hospitals and nursing homes. Actually, uh, if if their quality of care is not up to the mark. So that's, you know, those kind of programs are in place already in CMS for medicare. Uh, and so perhaps they can be brought in for community care providers of veterans. Um, care also. Uh, and then the other thing I wanted to mention on the false claims act was the earlier discussion. You know, we see 

[11:35:49 AM]

the sort of the dollar figure of the amount that was claimed through the false claims act. But there's very good evidence that shows that it has a very big deterrence effect. Also to prevent future fraud. Uh, and, you know, obviously that it's it's a little bit more speculative or subjective, but but those, uh, you know, the estimates of the deterrence effect are actually multiple times of the actual amount of money that was recovered from these lawsuits. So the false claims are actually is a very big piece, uh, of, of deterring bad behavior. 
>> Um, I just wanted to speak to the catching of the upcoding. I mean, I think you can look at data and, like you were saying, and see that this one doctor is billing this very high level, um, claim over and over and over again, and, and then you go from there, kind of you can look at the data and kind of see and then do your investigation, but also, you know, having a whistleblower 

[11:36:50 AM]

inside that knows the scheme that comes forward is the number one way to catch that. 
>> Yeah. Just, just. Uh, this has all been, uh, extremely interesting. And I thank all of you for being here and taking time out to be with us and to share all of the information that you have. And it just makes me think so much that we have so much to do around healthcare. Um, it's just sort of mind blowing, uh, in some sense. And, um, but I'm glad that all of you are out there. So, um, when we have the gavel and can begin to move things forward again, we have you as, um, a source of great information and help and certainly with policy, um, recommendations is huge. I was kind of curious to know. I don't know how long the Oregon law has been in effect, but, 

[11:37:52 AM]

doctor. To say, um, you mentioned some something going on in Massachusetts in terms of new legislation. I'm just wondering if if there have, has there been any impact in terms of. Private equity moving away from those states? It's like, oh, you're going to make it a lot harder on me now, and you're going to have eyes on me now. Um, so maybe I may go to another state. 
>> Yeah. The, the Oregon legislation just passed this summer, so it's too soon to tell. And it has a several year implementation window to allow the msos to restructure their agreements. Um, but I think that that's a call to all the researchers to make sure we study the effects of these policies. 
>> But again, I will just say thank you. Um, and I know, um, the ranking member, um, and soon to be our chair, it has 

[11:38:52 AM]

obviously taken a deep dive into this issue and cares deeply about it. So, um, I hope very much to work with him as the ranking member and hopefully chair of the health subcommittee and and partnering with him to to move forward to see how we can certainly, certainly within the confines of veterans health care, um, and veterans health care that they have to receive. Um, in, in, in the private industry, how, how we can sort of mitigate that. So, um, I'm sure all of you are working with other members in congress, on other committees who are taking a deep dive into our public health system, uh, throughout the country. So thank you. Yeah. 
>> And I apologize for bringing. He wears many hats and one of the most important features of all of this funding is simply 

[11:39:54 AM]

that. 
>> Amendments, um, for transgender. 
>> Service members. 
>> Right now. 
>> So, um, he. Thanks you all for being here for all of the work that you all have done for us. Um, for at the staff level, we were able to put our, um, summer law clerk was able to put together, um, who is now interning for senator cappelletti. Very, very good choice by you, senator. Um, put together a beautiful memo that, um, all the citations were the people in this room. So, um, just very, very grateful for your all's partnership. This is the beginning of, um, hopefully, uh, a long term relationship between the committee and you all, um, we I think I talked to all of you that, um, substance use treatment is where we want to go next, and we're going to need you all to help. I was going to help. Yeah. So thank you all very, very much. 
>> Oh, yeah. Well, I.

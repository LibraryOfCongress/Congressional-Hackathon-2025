[10:08:28 AM]

discuss a tragedy and a bill bearing another name of a victim of an illegal alien crime, the Kayla Hamilton act, named after 20 year old Kayla Marie Hamilton. A little more than three years ago on July 27th, 2022, Kayla Hamilton was violently attacked and murdered in her home in Aberdeen, Maryland. During the attack, Kayla tried to call her boyfriend to help her and ended up leaving a haunting voicemail recording the struggle. Her boyfriend later found her strangled to death, not breathing her iPhone cord wrapped tightly around her neck. Authorities later determined Kayla had also been sexually assaulted before leaving her lifeless body. Her assailant robbed her of the $6 cash that she had that was in her purse. Tragically, Kayla's horrific murder was entirely preventable. Kayla's murderer, Walter Javier Martinez, was a 16 year old salvadoran national. Martinez had been encountered in March of 2022 by us customs and border patrol officials at the southwest border during the 

[10:09:28 AM]

biden-harris administration. He even admitted to authorities that members of his family paid $4,000 to a guide, a so-called guide, to smuggle him from el Salvador to the United States border, as is required by law with most unaccompanied alien children, Walter was transferred to the the custody of the office of refugee resettlement at HHS. Rather than determining whether Martinez posed any threat to himself, to others or the community, the biden-harris HHS promptly placed Walter with a sponsor, purportedly his first cousin. Although that's in dispute. He ran away from her home just one month after settlement, and his sponsor later told that Martinez left because he, quote, because he wanted to, quote, do what he was doing in his home country, get in trouble on the streets and hang out with gang members. Only after Kayla's murder did any government official even attempt to find out whether Martinez had a criminal history. The local police learned from the salvadoran authorities that Martinez was an Ms. 13 gang member, with a 2020 arrest 

[10:10:29 AM]

record for illicit association with the violent gang. Martinez's HHS case file, reviewed by the judiciary committee, also revealed that he had gang tattoos. Why did no federal official try to determine the criminal history of a 16 year old salvadoran national entering the us illegally, because the biden-harris administration didn't care to? Instead, the secretary of HHS, Javier Becerra, cared only about moving hundreds of thousands of uacs out of HHS custody as quickly as possible. As the new York Times reported, Becerra pressured HHS employees to expedite uic processing and placement, saying, quote, if Henry Ford had seen this in his plants, he would have never become famous and rich. This is not the way to do an assembly line. Because of this careless approach. Necessary checks about Martinez's background and potential affiliation with Ms. 13 were never performed. Incredibly, biden-harris officials were in regular contact with the home countries of the uacs for reasons not associated with their criminal 

[10:11:30 AM]

history. In a 2023 transcribed interview with the committee, the director of Orr admitted that while it was commonplace for HHS to contact the consulate or embassy of the uoc's home country to verify certain documents like birth certificates under the biden-harris administration, HHS was not asked those same countries about whether uacs had any relevant criminal history. In Martinez's case, just one phone call would have made all of the difference. Brazen criminal that he is, Martinez wrote a letter from prison admitting to four murders, two rapes, countless thefts and other crimes in August of last year, justice was served when Martinez was convicted of murder and sentenced to 70 years in prison. Criminal organizations, cartels and gangs have for years exploited the vulnerabilities of the uac program, cracks that were only widened by the destructive policies put forth over the last four years. Indeed, the case of Walter Javier Martinez is not isolated, but part of a larger, disturbing pattern. Just a few 

[10:12:31 AM]

months ago, in April, right outside of my district in Lancaster, South Carolina, a woman named Larissa Cherelle Thompson, a mother of two, was murdered. Miss Thompson was on her way to a birthday party when six illegal aliens schemed to rob her vehicle. Three of these individuals a 13 year old, a 14 year old and a 15 year old enter the entered the us as uacs. Horrifically, these criminal aliens randomly targeted miss Thompson, surrounded her car and shot her to death for no reason at all. Ux, who have committed murder and other horrific crimes once in the us, are not uncommon. In 2016, Iowa nursing school graduate Sarah root was murdered by a uac. In 2021, a uac in Florida murdered his sponsor. In 2023, a uac in Texas sexually assaulted and murdered a ten year old girl on August 15th, 2025. Just this year, ice apprehended a former uac wanted in Honduras for illegal possession of a firearm and drug trafficking. Days later, on August 18th in Virginia, a former uac was arrested for aggravated sexual 

[10:13:32 AM]

battery on a victim under the age of 13. The uac was indeed, since February of this year, at least 6600 former uacs have been rearrested by ice for engaging in criminal conduct, including serious and violent criminal offenses. Time and time again, we see that there are dangerous and violent individuals who are spending time in HHS custody among the truly innocent children HHS is entrusted to protect. At the same time, we have also seen failures in the vetting of sponsors exposed over the last four years as record high numbers of uacs are encountered at the border and transferred into HHS custody, the biden-harris administration rushed out the door without waiting for the results of potential sponsors. Background checks. In some cases, HHS failed to even initiate the required background checks in the first place. Under president Biden and secretary Becerra, HHS ended the practice of performing background checks on all adult residents of potential sponsors households, 

[10:14:32 AM]

allowing children to potentially be placed in homes where criminals lived as long as those adults themselves were not listed as the sponsor. With long standing best practices in the uac placement process stripped away, it is no wonder that the last administration lost track of so many uacs. Many have ended up exploited by criminals or working in dangerous conditions, dangerous conditions that children are legally prohibited from performing. For example, in July of this year, at least eight uacs were found during a worksite raid on a California marijuana facility. Former uacs have also been found working on kill floors in meatpacking plants, operating giant ovens to make chewy or nature valley granola bars, or packing bags of cereal. The trump administration has committed to locating as many of these uacs as it can, although many have aged out and are no longer minors. Thus far, the trump administration has found nearly 23,000 of the uacs. More than 400 sponsors have been arrested, and 27 of the minors have been 

[10:15:32 AM]

found dead, either by murder, suicide or drug overdose. The evidence is clear the biden-harris administration's policies incentivized the trafficking, smuggling, and exploitation of children while simultaneously endangering American communities with foreign national gang members taking advantage of the Democrats insane border policies, the trump administration is committed to protecting children and bringing children, traffickers, gang members, and bad actors to justice, and the us placement process is not functioning as intended, and it is ripe for reform. That's what brings us here today. The cayley-hamilton act will ensure that American communities and uacs alike are protected. Some of the provisions I will describe will be added to the base text of the bill through an amendment in the nature of a substitute, this legislation will require all uacs to be assessed, not only to ensure that the child is protected from exploitation, but also to determine if the child presents a flight risk, has a criminal history, or presents danger to themselves or others. For those uacs 12 

[10:16:34 AM]

years of age or older. HHS will also conduct a screening for gang affiliation, including assessing the uac for any relevant gang related criminal history or gang tattoos. If HHS had conducted such a screening in Walter Javier Martinez's case, Kayla might be alive today. Thankfully, because of the funds appropriated in the reconciliation bill, the trump administration is always already ensuring these checks are being performed. Utilizing hsc investigators who are trained to interview children. Additionally, under this legislation, if the checks performed reveal that a uac 12 years of age or older satisfies certain factors like having a gang tattoo, criminal history related to gang activity or affiliation, or an aggravated felony, the uac will be placed in a secure facility while his or her immigration proceeding plays out in court. Secure facilities are designed to house children who are a danger to themselves or to others. H.R. 4003 71 will also ensure 

[10:17:36 AM]

that uacs are protected from those who wish to exploit them. This legislation closes the loophole in current law that allows illegal aliens to sponsor uacs. The bill also includes common sense reforms that bar uacs from being placed with criminals convicted of serious crimes. Us. Finally, the bill ensures that HHS conducts thorough background checks of uac sponsors that uax will not be placed with a sponsor until HHS actually receives the results of the required background checks, like sex offender checks and FBI national criminal history checks based on fingerprints. Waiting for a background check. Results before placing a child with an unknown sponsor is simply common sense. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. Let's honor Kayla's memory and take seriously the problem of criminal alien uacs victimizing our citizens I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. The ranking member is recognized for an opening statement. 
>> Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to Mr. Fry for bringing this legislation 

[10:18:36 AM]

forward. Uh, what happened to Kayla Hamilton was a devastating tragedy and a horrific, outrageous crime. And I can tell you, there's no heartbreak like the heartbreak of losing your child. Um, of course, as our colleagues often tell us after another mass shooting in an elementary school like in Newtown, Connecticut, or uvalde, Texas, or a high school like in parkland, Florida, the occurrence of a human catastrophe does not compel a specific public policy answer. Even the most obvious ones, like banning military style assault weapons or imposing a universal, violent criminal background check. Every bill has to be defended on its merits. This legislation is an example of a policy response that is a non-sequitur, um, using the horror of Kayla's death as its premise, the majority has drafted a bill that seems to put politics first. Not children, not 

[10:19:36 AM]

parents, for example. The bill requires that all unaccompanied children over the age of 12 be strip searched so that a government agent or handler can inspect their bodies for tattoos, and specifically images that the agent might interpret to be a gang related tattoo. If such tattoos are discovered, the children are then to be detained in a secure facility, essentially sending them to prison. Remember, the tattoos are common, with one third of Americans and people all over the world having them, and a higher proportion among young people. Um, our immigration agencies are notoriously bad at interpreting the meaning of tattoos. We all remember when the trump administration claimed that an autism awareness tattoo meant that Jose Alvarado borges, a baker and asylum seeker, was a member of trend aragua and carted him off to the notorious 

[10:20:37 AM]

salvadoran gulag Seacat. Um, Kayla Hamilton, incidentally, herself had autism. Um, the bill also requires that any child with an arrest record, uh, not a conviction, but an arrest record related to gang activity, be detained in a secure facility. This sounds reasonable at first. Until you think of the societies where these kids might be coming from and the criminal justice systems that we would be relying on under the bill. A teenager arrested by maduro's dictatorship in Venezuela or Putin's regime in Russia could be placed in jail simply for having protested for democracy and then being branded a gang member by Vladimir Putin, who we all remember called alexei navalny a gangster in a criminal. Um, this bill does not define gang activity in any way. Remember, the trump 

[10:21:38 AM]

administration sent hearsay Reyes Barrios to seek out Barrios, uh, was a professional soccer player who had protested against the maduro regime and was detained and tortured by government agents before he sought safety and refuge here in the United States. He was sent to Seacat after being accused of being a gang member by the maduro regime, and the only evidence for his imprisonment here was a tattoo on his body, a tattoo of a soccer team logo, something that millions of people have all over the world. That was the basis for describing a professional soccer player, um, as, uh, a. The legislation also gratuitously attacks immigrant families. It says that children cannot be placed with a sponsor unless they are a us citizen or a lawful permanent resident, but this flies in the face of 

[10:22:38 AM]

the American legal standard, which is what is actually in the best interests of the child. Children should be placed with the adults who are best positioned to take care of them and to raise them. But this bill prohibits family members who are lawfully in the united States to take custody of the kids if they are h-1b Visa holders, for example, or refugees, or here on a student Visa, uh, or they're here on any, uh, any of a number of different lawful statuses. This straightjacket provision will deny kids the ability to go to loving homes and force them, undoubtedly, to languish, sometimes in government custody for months, even if there are ready and willing family members wanting to take them in. If that's not putting politics over the interests of kids, I don't know what is. The subtitle of the bill claims its purpose is to enhance efforts to combat the trafficking of children. How does it help stop child trafficking to subject to subject children, to strip searches and force them to 

[10:23:40 AM]

remain in government custody? When loving family members are ready and willing to take them in? Finally, the test right now of our commitment to protect children is whether we will stand by the broad public demand for the immediate release of the complete Epstein file. The president of the United States, who is Epstein's best friend for more than a decade, once demanded the release of the file, but he now, uh, seeks to cover it up and calls the child trafficking trafficking scheme a hoax and totally irrelevant. Um, after Ghislaine Maxwell was subpoenaed to testify on this hallway by the oversight committee, deputy attorney general Todd Blanche was sent to interview her. This convicted felony sex offender, Epstein's partner in human trafficking and serial liar, not to gain new information 

[10:24:41 AM]

about the case, but to try to exonerate trump, whose name is apparently all over the Epstein files. It was clear from the interview Mr. Blanche believes he is still acting as Donald Trump's personal criminal defense lawyer. He certainly not acting as a public official representing the best interests of the American people. Following their conversation, miss Maxwell, who is seeking a pardon and clemency from president trump for her sordid crimes, uh, was moved almost overnight to a federal minimum security prison, colloquially known as club fed. This is a prison that does not normally accept felony sex offenders at all. She skipped the entire process of having to prove that there is some compelling justification for transferring her from one prison to another, an extraordinarily difficult process that ordinarily takes six months or more to happen. And she was moved pretty much overnight to this special cushy prison. Um, meanwhile, um, our 

[10:25:42 AM]

friends across the aisle with a few notable and honorable exceptions, including representative Massie, a member of this committee, representative boebert, representative Greene, and representative mace are essentially passively participating in trump's cover up, um and dismissing the demand of the survivors. The victims of Epstein's crimes, who are demanding a complete accounting and release of the total Epstein files. Um, so I want to commend, uh, our colleagues, both on the democratic side and the Republican side, who have signed on to the discharge petition for standing up for the victims, standing up for the survivors, and having the courage of their convictions to stand up in the face of this bizarre u-turn in the president's position. If the majority wants to combat child trafficking, let's start by ensuring total transparency and accountability for one of the most prolific and horrifying sex trafficking rings in the 21st century. We must make it 

[10:26:44 AM]

clear to anyone who participates in the exploitation and trafficking of children, regardless of their position or their political party. They will be held accountable under the law. Democrats stand united on this. I'm sorry to say that our Republican friends don't, but it is not too late to join us in standing up for this discharge petition. I yield back to you, Mr. Chairman. 
>> Gentleman yields back. Without objection, all other opening statements will be included in the record. The chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina to offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute. 
>> Amendment, Mr. Chairman. 
>> Clerk will report the amendment. 
>> Amendment in the nature of an. 
>> Objection, the amendment, the nature of a substitute be considered as read, and shall be considered as base text for the purposes of amendment. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina to explain the amendment. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This amendment makes various changes to the bill, including creating a consultation process to protect uacs clarifying which individuals are eligible to serve as sponsors of the uacs. Adding additional relevant items to the list of 

[10:27:46 AM]

information that HHS must provide before placing a uac with a sponsor and adding a severability clause, effective date clause, and exempting the bill from requirements of the paperwork reduction act and administrative procedures act. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment in the nature of the substitute to H.R. 4371, and I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. Who seeks recognition? 
>> Um, Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment I'd like to introduce. 
>> A report. 
>> Point of order being reserved by the gentleman from California. 
>> Mr. 
>> Hang on a second. 
>> Okay. 
>> Clerk will report, and then we'll go. 
>> Amendment to the amendment, in the nature. 
>> Of the amendment be considered as read. The gentleman from Maryland is recognized to explain the amendment. 
>> Thank you kindly. My amendment is simple, Mr. Chairman. Uh, it would not let this bill take effect until all the Epstein files are released. 

[10:28:46 AM]

My Republican colleagues have put forward multiple bills. This markup that reflect what they say is a renewed focus on protecting kids against trafficking and exploitation. Uh, well, this is the test. Uh, if our colleagues are serious, and I believe they are, then they should be happy and eager to join me in supporting this amendment. The text before you is the same text as Mr. Massie and Mr. Khanna's discharge petition that every Democrat and four of our Republican colleagues, uh, have joined in. In just the last 48 hours, we've seen how important it is that the public actually get to see the Epstein files for ourselves. The oversight committee has received Mr. Epstein's entire 50th birthday book, courtesy of Mr. Epstein's estate. This includes the now infamous and slightly juvenile birthday note and drawing that president trump denied existed at all. In fact, he sued the Wall Street journal for $10 billion for reporting that 

[10:29:47 AM]

trump had written, uh, this suggestive and lascivious uh, note with the drawing of, uh, a well, perhaps an underage girl's body. Hard to say exactly what it is, but, um, in that note, he draws an outline of a woman's naked body, a young woman's naked body. Uh, wishes Jeffrey Epstein happy birthday. And that ends it with may every day be another beautiful secret. Well, this is now public, and it clearly includes the president's signature. He's disputing that it's his signature, but it looks exactly like about 100 other signatures that we have from the president, including on federal legislation. So let's not allow this to be another beautiful secret before, uh, before we proceed, let's open up. Open up the Epstein files. The book also includes some disturbing, never before seen images that appear to 

[10:30:49 AM]

depict Epstein grooming young girls, and includes a never before seen document where Epstein and a longtime mar a Lago member are joking about selling a woman a, quote, fully depreciated woman to Donald Trump for 22,000 and $500. You can see it yourself if you have any doubt about it. Look, it's time for all of us to decide. Democrats and Republicans alike. The country is unified around this. Are we going to be on the side of transparency and accountability, or we can be on the side of the human traffickers and those who collaborate with them and collude with them and protect them? There is a stench of corruption, predation and exploitation that now hangs over this whole matter. And we are seeing one of the greatest cover ups of our century unfolding in real time. Which side are we on? That cover up, of course, starts with Alex Acosta, Donald Trump's secretary of labor, who gave 

[10:31:50 AM]

Epstein a ridiculous plea bargain, ending the federal case against him for no apparent reason other than his wealth, his connections, his political power. There was a multi-count federal indictment ready to go. And Alex Acosta, who was the us attorney in the southern district of Florida, gave it up and instead traded it for one count of solicitation. It didn't even mention child sex trafficking, one count of solicitation under Florida state law. He got the sweetest of sweetheart contracts. He was free in the daytime for several months. And then he went and spent the night in jail. And allegedly, he continued his criminal activities, grooming and procuring girls and having sex with underage girls and young women. So, uh, this is about corruption. This is about the wealthy and powerful being able 

[10:32:50 AM]

to manipulate the American justice system to get away with their crimes against kids. Let's release the file to the public. Vote yes on this, everybody. Let's make some history today. Let's make some history that we are going to see that the Epstein files actually come to light. That's what America wants the most liberal people, the most conservative people, people across the spectrum want to see the files. We don't want dribs and drabs of the files. They want us to see. We want the files they don't want us to see. We want the entire the entire case file that they've got. Let's clear the air. Let's get the truth and the facts out there. Let's put an end to this corruption and cover up. Let's do it on a bipartisan basis. I hope my colleagues will support the amendment and I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. Gentleman from California. Does the gentleman insist on his point of order? 
>> I do, Mr. Chairman. 
>> Uh, the gentleman's amendment would introduce. 
>> Oh, sorry. 

[10:33:51 AM]

>> Sorry, Mr. Chairman, I fail to see. 
>> Recognized to speak to his objection. 
>> I fail to see how the gentleman's obvious case of trump derangement syndrome has anything to do with this bill affecting immigration law. It's therefore not germane. I also question whether the gentleman's vicious attack on the president's character is in violation of the house rules. But I'll stick with the germaneness question for now. Uh. 
>> The gentleman wish to speak on. 
>> I certainly do. Um, I don't know what deranged trump syndrome is because I've not met with his psychiatrist, so I don't know what you're referring to with deranged trump syndrome. In any event, you haven't contradicted a single fact that I put forward. Uh, it seems like you want to try to impinge on my free speech rights or my speech and debate rights. That's a bizarre, uh, turn of events, given that we've just been talking about the first amendment and freedom of speech. But in any event, this is completely material and relevant. It's about the Acosta deal is about providing 

[10:34:52 AM]

immunity from federal prosecution to Epstein and all of his unnamed coconspirators. They were protected by that sweetheart deal. And this is about child sex trafficking, and the legislation is all about the protection of children. I don't see how it could be more aligned with the legislation here. Look, if you oppose it, if you don't want the file coming out, at least have the backbone and the courage to stand up and say, you don't want it coming out. But don't say this isn't relevant to the protection of children. Give me a break. I yield back. Mr. Chairman. 
>> I would just point out that the oversight committee is conducting an investigation. And in fact, it's the oversight committee that subpoenaed the very document the chairman referenced in his statement. So they are doing their work there, and they will be deposing the gentleman he recognized in his comments. Mr. Acosta, I think in two weeks that deposition is slated to happen. The gentleman's amendment does not satisfy the subject matter and fundamental purposes test. Therefore, it is not germane and is out of order. 

[10:35:53 AM]

>> Mr. Chairman, I'd like to appeal that. And the reason is, you know, Epstein used a ring of associates to rotate the women and girls in and out of sexual servitude, and many of them came from outside of the country. So this is all about human trafficking. He ran. He ran an international sex ring. And now you want to say it's not relevant to the legislation which deals with the protection of children? I do. 
>> Appeal following the. 
>> Ruling, I move to table the appeal. 
>> The gentleman has moved to table the appeal. 
>> Mr. Chairman. 
>> All those in favor? 
>> Mr. Chairman, I have a point of order. 
>> Gentlelady can state a point of order. 
>> Mr. Chairman, could you give the rationale for why this is not germane? Because I don't I simply don't understand it. I mean, the fact that the oversight committee is doing something does not negate our ability to do something. If you want to vote against the amendment, I suppose you could do that. But why is it not germane? This is about this bill is about unaccompanied minors. We know that there is trafficking. It is about trafficking. It is about sexual abuse. It is about all the 

[10:36:53 AM]

things that the Epstein, the release of the Epstein documents are also about. So what is the rationale for ruling it not germane versus you saying that you don't support the amendment, which. 
>> No, I didn't say. I didn't say I didn't support the amendment. I said that it's not germane. It doesn't know the rules. An amendment may make the effectiveness of a bill subject to a condition. If that condition is related to the provisions of the bill. An amendment delaying. 
>> Related to provisions of the bill. 
>> Does not satisfy the rules, and that is why it's not germane. 
>> So there's no rationale. 
>> There's an appeal of the ruling of the chair. There's been a motion to table that the question is on tabling of the motion. All those in favor say aye. Aye. Those opposed. No. No opinion of the chair. The ayes have it. 
>> Like a recorded vote, Mr. Chair. 
>> Recorded vote being requested. The clerk will call the roll. 
>> Mr. Jordan. 
>> Yes. 
>> Mr. Jordan votes yes. Mr. Issa, Mr. Biggs, Mr. Mcclintock. Mr. Mcclintock votes aye Mr. Tiffany, Mr. Massie Mr. Massie

[10:39:58 AM]

>> Clerk will report. 
>> Mr. Chairman, there are 14 eyes and 12 noes. 
>> The amendment is tabled. Who seeks recognition? 
>> Mr. Chairman, I'd like to strike the last word. 
>> Gentleman is recognized. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh, you know, just following up on a little bit of what the ranking member, uh, was discussing, there was a significant event this week, uh, in which this committee has jurisdiction over, uh, the speaker of the house, the third highest ranking us official, third in line to be the 

[10:40:58 AM]

president looked into the TV cameras and told us that the current president of the united States was an FBI informant. Um, I consider that to be gigantic news. And I'm just curious, have we reached out to the FBI to Kash Patel to confirm whether the president was at any time an FBI informant? I only say that because the speaker of the house obviously gets significant briefings. He gets briefings that we do not get, uh, as regular members. And so I think this is something that we need to hear definitively before Kash Patel comes. We should clear up. Maybe we should send a letter to him to find out if the president was an informant and if he was an informant. Is that because he was working with the FBI after he was hanging out with Jeffrey Epstein? Did he turn because he got caught with Jeffrey Epstein? You know, when you're an FBI informant, there are lots of questions about how you became an FBI informant. 

[10:41:59 AM]

And then how long was he an FBI informant? When did his service to the FBI stop? You know, being a member of the deep state, when did he stop doing that? I mean, look, any if a regular member had said this, I would discount it. But the speaker of the house is the one who said it. And then he said afterwards, well, I may have misspoke. Well, what was his misspeak instead of informant? Did he mean agent? I mean, what is the misspeak for informant? I mean, I don't know, another word that we use when we're describing an FBI agent or FBI informant or undercover. I mean, what what was the misspeak here? And if he was lying, then is he lying now? I'm just confused. Perhaps maybe the speaker should come to our committee and tell us what he meant when when he said that. It's just it's an order. It. I'm still speaking. I'm not. I'm still speaking. I'm not. 
>> Is there a bill or an amendment on the floor? 
>> I'm strike the last word. 

[10:43:01 AM]

I'm allowed to finish my. 
>> Gentleman's gentleman. Gentleman's gentleman from Florida has the time he's speaking. I think he's speaking about the bill. Uh, well, he's not really speaking about the bill, but he's recognized to speak about the bill. 
>> Well, he's just been, uh, interrupted for about 30s. I'd ask that it be added back on to his. 
>> Can we move to restore his time? That was a completely improper interjection. 
>> We'll give you plenty of time. I'm usually good about that. 
>> Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your indulgence. And I'm only bringing it up again because this committee is the committee of jurisdiction over the FBI. And I don't think in the history of this country, we've had a speaker of the house say the president was an FBI informant. I mean, that is I mean, that's a dual role of I ever heard one. And so I just think we have we have questions, Mr. Chairman, and on a bipartisan basis, maybe the answer is no. He wasn't an FBI informant. And that's fine. If the answer is no, I just think we need to hear from the FBI. The speaker has confused the American people whether trump 

[10:44:01 AM]

was working with the FBI against Jeffrey Epstein because he had information about Jeffrey Epstein, because he was there for a long period of time and then and then got turned maybe by the FBI. I mean, did trump ever go undercover? I mean, these are questions that the speaker has raised, by the way, president going undercover would be interesting, you know, but but these are questions that he's raised that is not a misspeak. There is not another adjective or verb for FBI informant. Right? I understand the president kicked him out of his club. That doesn't make you an FBI informant. So I think we need to get to the bottom of that. Um, will the gentleman yield? I will, I would just. 
>> To add on to that, um, in 2002, the president said. 
>> That he was aware that Jeffrey Epstein likes girls on the younger side. In 2003, he, uh, provided a birthday card 

[10:45:01 AM]

with the shape of a woman, uh, his clear signature, uh, for anyone who actually looks at it, uh, and references a secret. In 2004, the FBI initiated an investigation into Jeffrey Epstein. We. I would like for this committee to request from the FBI the opening document, the report of investigation that would have initiated the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein in 2004, because I think we should know how that investigation began. We know that president trump had a falling out with Jeffrey Epstein around that time. Was it president trump who provided the FBI with the information that caused this investigation to be opened? This committee deserves to know that I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. Who seeks recognition? The 

[10:46:02 AM]

gentleman from Maryland. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh, I want to follow up on the excellent points made by the gentleman from Florida and from New York. Um, let's try this again. Um, I've got an amendment at the desk. 
>> The clerk will report. The gentleman from California reserves. A point of order. 
>> Amendment to the amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 4371 offered by Mr. 
>> Objection. The amendment be considered as read. The gentleman from Maryland is recognized to explain. 
>> The amendment. Mr. Chairman, thank you. Ensures the release of all files associated with Alex Acosta in the Epstein affair. Um, the gentleman from New York focuses our attention on the fact that this was being investigated back in 2004, five and six, and in may of 2007, an assistant U.S. Attorney working for doj prepared a draft 60 

[10:47:05 AM]

criminal count indictment against Epstein, 60 criminal counts, statutory rape, rape, solicitation, human trafficking conspiracy, and so on. They had a very comprehensive and complex understanding of what Epstein was doing, how he was funding it, who was involved in it. And just two months later, Epstein's attorneys met with the us attorney for the southern district of Florida that us attorney would later become famous as Donald Trump's secretary of labor. But at that point, he, uh, was leading the investigation, and he offered to end the investigation and throw away those 60 federal charges completely if Epstein would plead guilty to the state charge of solicitation. Now, that has got to be the sweetest, coziest sweetheart deal ever made by a federal prosecutor. They've got this guy dead to 

[10:48:05 AM]

rights on 60 criminal counts of running a comprehensive child sex trafficking conspiracy. An international one. For those of you who are sticklers for, uh, materiality and relevance, an international child sex trafficking ring. Um. And they gave it all away. They accepted. Um. Uh, a short jail stay for him. So what did he get to do down there in Florida? Well, he pled guilty, and he got 18 months in a minimum security facility. He was allowed to leave for 12 hours a day, uh, to work at a foundation he founded and apparently continued doing exactly what he was doing before. And I don't want to be too graphic and lurid, uh, because there might be kids watching. Um, but he was doing precisely the kinds of things that we're talking about in terms of the 

[10:49:06 AM]

protection of children. He was violating children, violating young women, and then he would go and spend the night in jail. And in the meantime, he was able to bargain immunity for all of these other people who were working for him. 
>> The gentleman yield? 
>> Yes, by all means. 
>> In other words, while he was doing all this sexual predation, the government was providing room and board and meals and making it cheaper for him to do so. 
>> That's not a bad way of looking at it, uh, especially because apparently it was a very comfy jail cell they set up for him. Now, I'm sure he would have preferred to be back in one of his mansions, uh, which were basically sexual dungeons for the young wen and girls that got swept up in his sex conspiracy, which was something that the vast majority of Americans deplore and abhor and want to get to the bottom of and want to know the truth about. But anyway, he spent those nights, and then they wiped the slate clean for him to continue to go on and do it again and again and again. 

[10:50:07 AM]

This is a guy who should have immediately been prosecuted and then convicted and sent to prison for the rest of his life for what he had done. Now, Ghislaine Maxwell was prosecuted, uh, and convicted as a felony sex offender and sentenced to 20 years in jail. She just got transferred out of her prison to a club fed, uh, in Texas, where sex offenders are not normally allowed. Felony sex offenders are not normally allowed there. But after she spoke to the president's former criminal defense attorney, who's now working in the department of justice, and he liked what he heard, she was immediately, uh, transferred over to this very comfy arrangement in Texas. She skipped over months and months of the normal process, where you have to prove there's some compelling reason to be transferred from one facility to another. Under the rules of the bureau of prisons. She bypassed all of that, and she 

[10:51:08 AM]

got sent over to this other prison because, well, Mr. Blanche liked what he heard when he went over to talk to her. Come on. We're the congress of the United States. The framers of the constitution thought that we would stand up for integrity, and we would stand up for our interests and not be servile partizan sycophants to the president of the United States. So let us all show some backbone today. Let's say we don't move forward on this legislation until that Epstein Acosta file is released. Let's vote for that, everybody. And if you're serious about getting the truth of it, you will support my amendment. I yield back to you, Mr. Chairman. 
>> Uh, the gentleman yields back. I would just point out that, uh, the director of the FBI will be sitting at that table one week from today. And all the questions and concerns Mr. Moskowitz raised, he can ask the director can ask him right to his face, get the answers. And then according. And then with regards to Mr. 

[10:52:09 AM]

Acosta, he will being be being deposed on the 19th of this month. So in nine days he'll he'll sit for a deposition where he will be under oath. Mr. Garcia, who has the job that Mr. Raskin used to have, can ask him all the questions, make all the points that, uh, the ranking member of the judiciary committee just raised. 
>> Mr. Chairman, you would agree that the. 
>> Questioning from California is. 
>> Recommended. 
>> The question being more meaningful if we actually had the file. 
>> Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order, gentlemen. 
>> Insist on his point of order. Does the sponsor amendment. Just recognize the gentleman? 
>> Thank you. I'm reminded of Churchill's definition of a fanatic. A man who can't change his mind and won't change the subject. But the subject has nothing to do with immigration law. Uh, which is a subject of this bill. And therefore the gentleman's amendment would introduce material beyond the scope and purpose of the bill before us. It violates house rule 16, clause seven I yield back. 
>> Yields back. The gentleman from Maryland wish to respond. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Mr. Chairman, I suppose I am a fanatic for child safety. I 

[10:53:11 AM]

am a fanatic against child sex trafficking. Yes, I am, and I will be a fanatic to stand up for the public interest and the vast majority of Americans who want the truth to come out and don't want to sweep it under the rug. The gentleman it's my time. I'm not. Yielding to you right now. I've heard enough from you. Now, Mr. Epstein's victims included aspiring models from abroad, including South America. He had a whole team working in France. 
>> The gentleman he used. 
>> The gentleman should focus on the point of order. 
>> This is. 
>> Focusing on the point of order, Mr. Chairman, because I'm talking. About the international dimension. 
>> Just reminding the gentleman who spoke more than anyone today here at this, this hearing. And he said that he's not going to support the bill, as the gentleman from California just pointed out. So if you can say. 
>> Oh, I want. 
>> To, that'll. 
>> Be good. I would love. 
>> To. 
>> Support the bill. If you support. 
>> The release. 
>> Of. 
>> The Epstein file and the Acosta file, I mean. 
>> Let's getting all the information we're forgetting all that information out. And that's why I've told you about. 

[10:54:11 AM]

>> Well, let's get it out today. 
>> I deposition and Mr. 
>> We've heard a lot of promises about getting it out. We haven't seen much action, a lot of promises, but no action today. We can take some action. The gentleman suggests that my amendment is not in order, because it's not germane to the question of international child trafficking and illegal immigration. Well, Mr. Epstein's victims, including aspiring models and girls being taken advantage of from south American countries and from Europe and France, he used a ring of associates to rotate the women and girls in and out of sexual servitude in different countries, in different places, using fraudulent modeling Visas to transport them across state lines and across international borders. He tracked their availability and their proximity using this database. This is exactly what we're talking about. It's hard to see how it could be more material, more germane and more relevant. It's also the case that, uh, air traffic controllers in the 

[10:55:11 AM]

Virgin Islands observed Mr. Epstein leaving his private plane in 2018 with girls who testimony suggested were as young as 11 or 12 years old. In one undated incident detailed in a lawsuit, a 15 year old girl attempted to escape and swim off of Mr. Epstein's island after she was forced to engage in sex acts with Mr. Epstein and some of his guests. The girl was found and held captive on the island after he confiscated her passport, the lawsuit said. So this goes on and on. I mean, you want to close your eyes to it, close your eyes to it and say it's not a big deal, but don't say it's not germane. You raised the question of the protection of children against international exploitation. This goes right to the heart of it, and I'm happy to yield to any of my colleagues who haven't had a chance to weigh in yet. The gentlelady from California. 
>> Uh, thank you, ranking member. I too will support this 

[10:56:11 AM]

amendment. I was appalled when I heard you say that they were preparing a 60 criminal count indictment against Alexander Acosta. You said 60. That's even more than 37. 
>> Not against Acosta, by Acosta, against Epstein. And they suppressed it. 
>> Yes. I was thinking 60. And then I was thinking 37 with trump. But 60 is a lot. And then I started thinking, you know, the underlying bill is actually we would be debating institutionalized child trafficking and abuse. If you actually look at the text of the underlying bill, which is why I support this amendment, we, the Republican, you all want us to stop talking about the Epstein files, but we would stop talking about them if you just released them and popped the balloon. And of course, everybody's going to show up and ask Kash Patel these questions. I'm trying to figure out why all the cover up, because at the end of the day, 

[10:57:12 AM]

we are talking about a man who orchestrated the sexual abuse, the sexual assault, the rape of little girls, of girls under the age of 18. In many instances, everyone is all up and flustered when you're talking about folks being on a sex registry about sex traffickers. But now all of a sudden, with Jeffrey Epstein and all these people in these files, they don't want to release, they don't want the truth. That is why I support this amendment, because it also begs the question of who else is in the files. And I want to know. 
>> Well, I thank the gentlelady. I'd like to yield to the gentlelady from Pennsylvania. Ms. Scanlon. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Raskin. Just as we're coming into this, it seems so clear. And it should be clear to anyone with a law degree who has ever 

[10:58:12 AM]

participated in litigation that you don't want to go into a deposition to question someone when you don't have all the facts that are available. So I wholeheartedly support the idea that we need to have all of the Epstein files released. Otherwise, the work that this committee is going to do is going to be hamstrung. It becomes another part of a cover up, you know, why won't they allow these files to be released when it would do the most good for this committee and this congress to do its work? I mean, what are they hiding? Um, I support the amendment, and I yield back to my colleague. 
>> I just would say, finally, Mr. Chairman, uh, this, uh, legislation is well intended in different ways, and it's very flawed in other ways. One of the ways in which it's flawed is it says that kids can only be put with, uh, us citizen or permanent resident, but not other people who have lawful presence in the country who may be family members. Um, don't we want a situation where all kids are taken care of so they don't, uh, so they don't end up in a 

[10:59:14 AM]

situation like this. They might be released to someone, uh, who's actually a child sex predator. This is completely gene and relevant, and I hope everybody supports the amendment. Thanks. 
>> That does not satisfy house rule 16, clause seven. And therefore the subject matter and fundamental purposes test and therefore is not germane and is out of order. 
>> I'd like to appeal the ruling of the chair. 
>> Gentlemen. Appeals the ruling of the chair. The gentleman from New Jersey makes a motion to table all those in favor of tabling the the motion to appeal, say I, I those opposed. No. No opinion of the chair. The ayes have it recorded. 
>> Vote please. Mr. Chairman. 
>> The vote being uh requested. The clerk will call the roll. 
>> Mr. Jordan. 
>> Yes.

>> Not in regular order. 
>> Mr. Ross. You're not recorded? No. Miss Ross votes? No. 

[11:05:21 AM]

>> Back here. 
>> Mr. Harris. Yes. Mr. Harris votes. Yes. 

[11:06:58 AM]

>> Mr. Chairman, just a quick point of order. Are we holding it open until members can come from other markup sessions? 
>> Yes, yes. 
>> Okay. Thank you. 

[11:09:42 AM]

>> Mr. Swallow. You're not recorded. Mr. Swallow votes? No. Mr. Neguse, you're not recorded. Mr. Neguse votes no. 

[11:10:46 AM]

>> We haven't even gotten to. 
>> The bill. 
>> Mr. Chairman, a point of order down here, am I correct? 
>> Mr. New York is recognized. 
>> This is a motion to table. Uh, the appeal of a ruling that this amendment is not germane. Is that what what was right. 
>> Was correct. 
>> So even if this were to be voted down, we would then just go into debate and discussion on the amendment with a vote on the amendment. Correct? 
>> No. We would go back to the discussion of the bill and who would seek recognition. 
>> Back to the discussion. 
>> No, this is just germaneness. 
>> Oh, on the oh, yeah. We go back to the discussion of the appeal. 
>> Of the amendment. 
>> Yeah. 
>> So for for those who oppose the amendment, there will be another opportunity to make sure it, uh, you can voice that opposition. Is that that correct? Not on. 
>> Not on this particular amendment if it's tabled, but on some subsequent amendment. That's that's up to you guys. 
>> No, no. If it is not tabled. 

[11:11:48 AM]

>> It's not tabled. Certainly. 
>> Then we consider the amendment. 
>> To the amendment. 
>> You're making 30 people. 
>> I expect the motion to be tabled. 
>> But you're making 30 people sit around waiting here when you'll have another opportunity. 
>> A number of markups going on. We have oversight. We have. 
>> I understand. 
>> And we're trying to get members here. I'm saying like the minority is trying to get members here. 
>> So I'm just saying this is an irrelevant vote in many respects, because you'll have an opportunity to. 
>> Vote in the United States. Congress is irrelevant. I think this is an important vote, and we're going to let members get here and cast their vote. 
>> Well, let me rephrase. This is not a determinative vote for this amendment. And so perhaps we could move on because we are all sitting here waiting. 
>> It's a determinative vote on the ruling of the chair, which I find somewhat important. Uh, and that's why we're going to wait until members get here and get a chance to cast their vote. 
>> Mr. Gale, Mr. Gale votes yes. 
>> Mr. Chairman. Point of inquiry. 
>> Gentleman from Florida will state. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Is 

[11:12:48 AM]

that a new shirt and tie? 
>> It's an old shirt, but maybe a relatively new tie. I'm not the slave to fashion. 
>> No, listen, the window pe. 
>> Looks far from ever being accused of slave to fashion. Like my good friend from Florida, with the many, many pairs of tennis shoes that he tennis shoes that he wears. So, uh, anyway, we will, uh, wait for a few more members to arrive. 
>> I just want you to know, Mr. Chairman, I noticed. 
>> Thank you so much. 

[11:18:16 AM]

>> Yes. 
>> Miss Hegeman, you're not recorded. Miss Hegeman votes. Yes. 

[11:23:12 AM]

Miss Crockett, you're not recorded. Miss Crockett. Votes? No. 

[11:25:43 AM]

>> Mr. Chairman, point of order. Thank you kindly. Would it be appropriate to use this downtime for some, um, unanimous consent requests? 
>> We're not. 
>> I don't think we're allowed to do that under the rules, but I appreciate you. 
>> Could we. 
>> Ask. 
>> Efficient. 
>> Mr. Raskin? 
>> Could could should we could we ask unanimous consent to waive the rules for the purpose of just doing some. 
>> Unanimous consent to do a unanimous consent? 
>> Yes. Wow. 
>> That may be. 
>> A first, I think. 
>> I think we'll I think we'll take the vote for Mr. The gentleman from California, Mr. 
>> Kiley votes. Aye. 
>> And we'll patiently wait for one more Republican. 

[11:26:50 AM]

>> Mr. Biggs. Mr. Biggs I. 2019. Mr. Chairman, there are 20 ayes in 19 noes. 
>> The motion to table is adopted or agreed to. I should say, um, uh. Mr. Chairman, gentleman from New Jersey is. Request gentlelady from Pennsylvania is recognized. 
>> Thank you. I seek unanimous consent to, um, introduce uh, red letter newsletter article from September 4th. What happened when an Epstein survivor confronted GOP rep boarding of flight? 
>> Without objection. 
>> Mr. Chairman. 
>> You see. No gentleman from New Jersey. I'll come to the gentleman. Gentlelady from Washington. Gentleman from new Jersey is recognized. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Mr. Chairman. I, I guess it's one of those times. 
>> I want to. 
>> Express that, uh, I don't quite understand where the. 
>> Other side of the. 

[11:27:51 AM]

>> Aisle is coming from here. Um, you know, this Epstein issue has been there for years. It was here during the Biden administration. It was here when just about all the members who spoke today were here. And yet, not a word. Virtually not a peep. We're going to have the opportunity to speak to the very pertinent players in this. The oversight committee is doing good work now as we speak. But what bothers me is when you take an issue as serious as this and the legislation that we should be voting on today and mix it in with politics. And what do I mean by that? My good friend Mr. Raskin, who I deeply respect, but he didn't talk about any of this with Epstein until a few months ago. 
>> Would the gentleman yield? 
>> No, I will not. I'm going to finish his main account. Didn't even mention the Epstein files once until June 5th of this year. This very year. Mr. Goldman didn't mention it really in his files until may 12th. Mr. Moskowitz, the best 

[11:28:51 AM]

of our knowledge, has never really mentioned it until recent time. I hear the moral righteousness, the righteous indignation, the supposed moral clarity. Where was it then? But now, because there's a change of administrations now, because it can sideline what's a very important bill. We're not going to let that happen. All of a sudden everybody's morally righteous. Everybody's morally pure. Everybody's morally concerned. We're all concerned about this issue. Right or left, Republican or Democrat, we are. But when it is used as a political tool, it is shameful to those young people who suffered. It is shameful to this institution. We have work here to do and to just start bringing it up. Now, you know, if if we saw for year after year after year after year, these folks have brought it up. But they did not. But now they 

[11:29:51 AM]

do. I think that is shameful. I think it's disturbing. I don't know where the real moral righteousness or the moral clarity is because I don't see it there. So, Mr. Chairman, I, you know, for one is just one member of this committee would suggest that we move forward and make sure that this good legislation that's been sponsored by Mr. Fry moves through that unaccompanied alien children under 12 years and older, that we protect them and take care of them, because we can do that now. We can't completely undo what is the past, but we can move forward and make sure in many ways that something else horrible doesn't happen. With that, I think somebody asked for me to yield. 
>> Yes. 
>> Kindly ranking member yes, I yield. 
>> Thank you very much. And it pains me to hear you impute hypocrisy and surplus moral self-righteousness to me. Um, and I'm afraid. 
>> It hurts me to have to do it. 
>> Well, I'm going. 
>> To have. 
>> To contradict the whole 

[11:30:52 AM]

premise of your little filibuster against me, because I'm going to introduce, for the record, a letter I wrote on July 10th, 2019, when I was chairman of the subcommittee on civil rights and civil liberties, uh, of the oversight committee. It's addressed to the honorable Alexander Acosta. Dear Mr. Secretary, we're writing to invite you to testify to hearing on July 23rd at 3 P.M. In room I. 
>> Reclaim my time. I get your point. Okay. 
>> Wait. 
>> Let me finish here. 
>> I want to read exactly what it's. 
>> About my time. But wait a second. I'll let you go back from New Jersey. I will say this. You have spoken more about it today in this one hearing than in all those previous years combined. I'll yield back to you again. 
>> All right, so the hearing will examine your actions as U.S. Attorney for the southern district of Florida and authorizing a non-prosecution agreement for Jeffrey Epstein, as well as the finding by a federal court that you violated the crime victims rights act by keeping this non-prosecution agreement secret from the many victims of Mr. Epstein's crimes. Your testimony is even more critical now that federal prosecutors in the southern 

[11:31:52 AM]

district of New York unsealed a new indictment earlier this week outlining a host of additional charges against Epstein, including luring dozens of teenage girls to his homes in New York City in palm beach and paying them to engage in sexual activity with him. My friend Mr. Van drew, I was railing about this. You may have forgotten because that was during the democratic period of your career, when you were on our side of the aisle and you blocked it out. 
>> Now I know. 
>> Thank god you may have blocked it out, but I. 
>> Did reclaim my time. I reclaim my time. 
>> Thank. 
>> Thank god I did change. And this is just a good example of that. Well, you have political ambition. That's my time. I still have many friends on the other side of the aisle. But here's the point. You still have spoken about it more today and yesterday and the day before than you did in all those years. 
>> That's the same fact checkers on that, making. 
>> It much, much more angry now than you ever were then. And I call that into question. I do, and that is my right. And I respect you, ranking member, 

[11:32:52 AM]

but I feel strongly that what you're doing here is wrong. We have an important bill here. We need to move this bill through I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. The gentlelady from Washington is recognized. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk. 
>> The clerk will report. Gentleman from California reserves. A point of order. 
>> Amendment to the amendment. In the nature of a substitute to H.R. 4371. 
>> Not. Objection. The will be considered as read. The gentlelady is recognized to explain the amendment. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think what you're hearing today in this committee is a great desire from all of us on this side to support the release of all the Epstein files. And I want to thank representative Marcy, um, as well as a couple of Republican members, representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren boebert, um, Nancy mace, for their commitment to be consistent about what we fight for here in 

[11:33:55 AM]

congress and why we as the judiciary committee, with oversight over the department of justice, over the FBI, should be discussing this very topic in this committee. And then the hypocrisy combined with that of the cover up by the majority of Republicans of a child sexual predator and trafficker and all that enabled him the hypocrisy of focusing on what is happening with immigrant kids while simply ignoring all of that and making germane arguments that simply don't make sense. Let me just read to you, uh, what the attorneys for Jeffrey Epstein said when they were here last week, they said a lawyer representing some of the survivors stated that in many of the victims were trafficked from other countries, including eastern European nations, where they had fewer rights and protections. Epstein's pattern of exploitation often involved targeting vulnerable young 

[11:34:57 AM]

children from broken homes with immigration status. Perhaps that was not fully vetted. Um, people who had been trafficked in by people and used immigration as a means for vulnerability, so to say. Now that these amendments that we're offering are not germane is simply it doesn't pass the smell test at all. You can vote them down. But to say they're not germane doesn't make any sense. The reality is that we literally thanks to representatives Massie and Khanna, had a dozen survivors of the horrific abuses of Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell and all the rich and powerful men who used their wealth and power to corrupt justice. So my amendment says that the bill doesn't go into effect until every single one of them in the networks is prosecuted to the full extent of the law. The majority claims 

[11:35:57 AM]

that the purpose of the bill, the underlying bill that we're supposed to be discussing, is to enhance efforts to combat the trafficking of children. Those are your words to enhance efforts to combat the trafficking of children. How can you claim to do that with any degree of credibility, when the vast majority of the participants in Jeffrey Epstein's child sex trafficking ring still remain at large? If we really want to combat child trafficking, we have to be clear that those who participate in child trafficking don't get a free pass in the United States. The idea that we're two signature short still on representative Massie and Khanna's discharge petition to release all of the Epstein files is confounding to me. I've had conversations with some of you. I've watched mostly the men slink out of the room every time this topic comes up. Most of the women are not here. We got a couple of men that sit it through like my 

[11:36:59 AM]

good friend Lance Gooden. At least he doesn't leave the room. But why aren't you all on that discharge petition? If you believe that this is, uh, something that included both Republicans and Democrats, I do. I think there are Democrats and Republicans that need to be held accountable in this, in this whole horrific scandal. Then get all of the files released and you can stand up for this. You can stand up for your daughters, for all of the other women out there, all of the other people who have been trafficked. And your base will love it. Your base wants these files released, so there's no political reason here for you not to do the right thing other than you're paying fealty to a cult leader who's telling you not to do it because his name is all over this thing. So I hope that even if you're voting down these amendments, or you're trying to make an 

[11:37:59 AM]

argument that they're not germane, which is ridiculous, that you sign the discharge petition, why don't you just put your signature on the discharge petition? And all of this will end because we will get to see the files in totality, not what the department of justice wants to release. I mean, the idea that we have, uh, the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, negotiate in secret an agreement to move Ghislaine Maxwell to a cushy prison. Prison? After what she's done should embarrass everybody. Everybody. Mr. Chairman, and I feel like I don't know how you go home to your to your daughters and your wives and say that you didn't put your signature on that discharge petition. So I think this amendment is germane, and I hope that we can discuss it, because there's a lot of 

[11:38:59 AM]

information we need, and I hope that, uh, we're able to have that conversation in this committee. I yield back. 
>> Gentlelady's time has expired. She yields back. The gentleman from California is recognized. And does he insist on his point of order? 
>> I do, Mr. Chairman. 
>> Gentleman is recognized. Uh. 
>> Mr. Chairman, nobody on this side of the aisle has anything but contempt and loathing for Jeffrey Epstein's predations. And there are many appropriate and germane opportunities for airing these concerns, including before this very committee next week. But it has nothing to do with this bill, and therefore introduces material beyond the scope and purpose of the bill before us, and therefore violates house rule 16, clause seven I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. The sponsor amendment wish to be heard on the point of order. 
>> Yes I do. 
>> Gentlelady is recognized. 
>> A notable example of an immigrant child exploited by Jeffrey Epstein is marina Lacerda, who came forward publicly with her story in September 2025. Lacerda was a vulnerable teenager new to the United States, living in queens with her family when she was 

[11:40:00 AM]

recruited into Epstein's trafficking ring. She emigrated from Brazil. She was 14 years old. She was struggling financially. A friend introduced her to Epstein under the pretense of a massage job that would pay hundreds of dollars. The situation quickly escalated, and Epstein and his associates forced her into sexual interactions. Lacerda has said that she eventually became part of a larger network of girls and young women who were recruited by Epstein in New York and trafficked from abroad. This is a pattern of exploitation, and exploitation survives because people are vulnerable to whatever conditions they are under, including their immigration status. This bill is about immigration and young girls. 
>> And the gentlelady children. I would, in fact, the subtitle of the bill is quote, to enhance efforts to combat the trafficking of children. Would your amendment enhance efforts to combat trafficking of children? 

[11:41:00 AM]

>> Absolutely. Mr. Ranking member, because it shows that there is a cost to pay. Why are we letting these people get away? What example does it send? All of these survivors last last week incredibly powerful testimonies talked about not just what it means for them, but what it means for all the other sexual predators that are out there, all the others that are being allowed to get away with continued trafficking because we don't crack down on this case. So, absolutely. And this is germane to this bill. Mr. Chairman, I ask that you rule it germane and you do what is actually right. And then we have a debate on the merits of the amendment. And if you want to vote it down, vote it down. 
>> The chair is obligated to follow the house rules. Will the gentleman's amendment does not satisfy the subject matter and fundamental purposes test. Therefore, it is not germane and is out of order. 
>> I appeal the ruling of the chair. 
>> Gentlelady appeals the ruling of the chair, the gentleman gentleman from California moves to table. All those in favor of tabling, say I. I. Those opposed? No. 

[11:42:01 AM]

>> No. 
>> Opinion of the chair. The ayes have it. 
>> Recorded vote, Mr. Chairman. And really disappointed. 
>> That we can't ask for a recorded vote. The chair will call the roll on the debate.

[11:45:04 AM]

ayes and 16 nos. 
>> The motion to table is agreed to. The gentlelady from Wyoming is recognized. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Kayla's mother is watching this hearing. She cannot figure out for the life of her what Jeffrey Epstein has to do with her daughter. And this bill. Kayla was murdered in Maryland. Where was the ranking member then? What efforts did he make to ensure that no other senseless murder like this happened? Using the life and death of Kayla Hamilton to score political points against the president is absolutely despicable. I'm going to read from the us department of homeland security, office of inspector general, the report that was issued in March 20th. On March 25th of this year, entitled ice, cannot effectively monitor the location and status of all unaccompanied alien children 

[11:46:04 AM]

after federal custody, because that's what the point of this bill is to address. Quote. After meeting with more than 140 individuals from dhs and other federal agencies, we determined us immigration and customs enforcement cannot effectively monitor the location and status of all unaccompanied alien children once released or transferred from the department of homeland security and the us department of health and human services custody from fiscal years 2019 to 2023, ice transferred more than 448,000 uacs to HHS. Most were released to sponsors. However, more than 31,000 of the 448,000 children releases addressed release addresses were blank, undeliverable, or missing apartment numbers. Ice also was not always aware of the location for uacs, who fled HHS custody. We found that ice did not effectively oversee uacs, subject to removal, by not issuing notices to appear 

[11:47:05 AM]

to all uacs to generate assignment of immigration coordinates by the us department of justice. As of January 2025, ice had not served ntas on more than 233,000 233,000 unaccompanied minors as of October 2024, ice reported more than 43,000 uac served. Ntas failed to appear for scheduled court dates. Finally, ice was not always notified of uacs status and safety unless an allegation or tip was reported. These issues occurred because ice did not always receive information about uacs sponsor locations from HHS and other federal agencies. Ice also had a limited staffing to monitor usc's cases, and did not have a policy for all officers to monitor uacs cases without an ability to monitor their location and status of uacs, 

[11:48:05 AM]

ice is unable to facilitate court appearances and has no assurance. Uacs are safe from trafficking, exploitation, forced labor, or involvement in criminal activities that may pose a risk to local communities. Kayla. Kayla. Hamilton. Kayla. Hamilton. Kayla. Hamilton. 
>> Write it down. 
>> For me. The reason for what this bill is about. Kayla Hamilton was brutally murdered by Walter Javier Martinez, a uac who was released to a sponsor, an individual who was responsible for housing and supervising the uac by HHS before any background checks were completed. Kayla Hamilton was brutally murdered by Walter Javier Martinez, a usc uac who was released to a sponsor by HHS before any background checks were completed. It is 

[11:49:05 AM]

critically important that we stay on task with the issue that is before us today, and that is addressing the brutal murder of Kayla Hamilton and ensuring that this kind of tragedy never happens again. This is not about Jeffrey Epstein. If the folks on the other side of the aisle would like to bring a bill about Jeffrey Epstein, we can address that. Do not solely Kayla Hamilton's name or her memory by turning this into a political sideshow, I urge, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this very well crafted, important bill. It is critical. It is critical that we be able to protect people like Kayla Hamilton. With that, I yield back. 
>> Gentlelady yields back. Well said. Uh, the gentlelady from California is recognized. 
>> I'd like to strike the last word, and I'd like to yield my remaining time to congressman 

[11:50:07 AM]

Moscowitz. 
>> Thank you. Uh, the gentlelady from California. I have breaking news for the gentlelady from Wyoming. The the idea of Jeffrey Epstein that we could bring it. I just want to let you know that there's a gentleman that sits right behind you. His name is Thomas Massie. He has brought a discharge petition that you may not have heard about it. He's brought a discharge petition that would release all of the Epstein files. Because I was listening to your speech, and I was listening to van drew speech, and it was a lot of words to say, I don't want to release the files. Right. Like that was a lot of words to say. I don't want to. 
>> You yield very briefly. Would you yield briefly? My words are about Kayla. 
>> Yeah. No. When I'm done, I'll yield. When I'm done, I'll yield to you. I want I'm done. So there's a discharge petition that would release the files. The reason why we talk about it in all these hearings is that we can't believe that you were all for releasing the files until the mothership beamed down the instructions to not 

[11:51:08 AM]

release the files. And then all of a sudden, it was a hoax. It's not real. Barack Obama, Joe Biden, right. We're going to send the private attorney to move Ghislaine Maxwell, right? We're going to do all of these things. We're just very surprised. And obviously, Mr. Massie has stuck to his principles and he's had a couple of others do that as well. Everybody else ran ran for cover. And so do you want to release the files and then I'll yield I mean, it's a yes or no. And then will you sign the petition? 
>> Will you yield? 
>> I will yes. Oh, I'm sorry, I gotta I gotta yield back to the I gotta, I gotta yield back. 
>> I'm sorry. Yield. I want to take some of my time because it's also very simple. Like I said before, release the files, put it out there, pop the balloon, let out all this air. I, too, would like to get to the point where we could discuss the underlying bill. There's a lot of problems with the underlying bill, but when 

[11:52:11 AM]

we met with the survivors, they said we want transparency. We want action, we want accountability. We don't know why there's a flyover happening. At the exact same time, we're holding a press conference. We don't know why members outside of those in the women's caucus and a few other brave folks don't want to meet with us and hear our story. We don't know why we're getting thrown under the bus and treated as if we are perpetrators. And I don't know why either. We come into this committee, the judiciary committee, which is supposed to 

[11:53:11 AM]

be about justice. And then we get subjective amnesia. And it's like, well, only justice for certain people. I don't know, for people who look like or look a certain way, speak a certain way, have a certain amount of money in their bank account. I thought, we have one set of laws that everyone supposed to follow. The survivors of the Epstein crimes seem to think the same to. And yet we have multiple sets of rules. So if you release the files, we can see who's rules, who's allowed to follow. We heard from survivors who said 

[11:54:14 AM]

Jeffrey Epstein said, I own the banks, I own the government. I can do what I want. We are talking about the Epstein files related to this bill, because the man was had multiple passports. He was traveling to far and away places like Monaco, Austria, Slovakia, Paris, Mexico, Morocco involved orchestrating an international ring of trafficking. Young women young enough to be someone's child, someone's grandchild. So vote on the amendments to release the files to give the survivors what they want transparency, action and accountability. And with that, I yield back my time. 
>> Gentlelady yields back. The 

[11:55:14 AM]

gentleman from Georgia is recognized. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We're here debating this bill, H.R. 4371, the Kayla Hamilton act, which purports to actually protect children. Uh, but at the same time, it requires that children over the age of 12 be physically inspected, uh, for gang tattoos. Now, you know, inspecting girls 12 years and older and maybe even racially profiling and figuring that a eight year old might be 12 year old. So you you, um, inspect a eight year old child, um, at a time when we don't know whether or not the. Jeffrey Epstein sex ring saga has been concluded or 

[11:56:14 AM]

not is very disturbing to me. I don't want to enshrine in the law, uh, a obligation for ice goons to be inspecting the bodies of 12 year old girls, uh, simply because they crossed the border, not knowing whether or not they are a part of this child sex predator. Uh, ring. You know, Donald Trump has trafficked in conspiracy theories for many, many years. Qanon, pizzagate. These are real theories that were propounded by trump and his supporters. The Jeffrey Epstein child sex predator ring was also a conspiracy theory, and it's the only one that has legs, or it's the only one that has 

[11:57:15 AM]

been proven to not be just simply a, uh, a conspiracy. It is not a hoax. It is a fact of life that this is an international child sex predator ring spanning the globe. It's international in its in its, uh, impact, including in Putin's, uh, Putin's Russia, including Russia. Putin. Was he involved in it? Well, Donald Trump said that when I get elected, I'm going to release the files. It's going to knock the socks off of you. The names on the client list, the names in the files, we'll get it done. And so they come into office. Pam Bondi says on national TV, I've got the file on my desk. I'm 

[11:58:15 AM]

going to review it and release it. But then shortly thereafter, within days thereafter, suddenly, she takes the opposite approach she, she and Kash Patel come out and say, okay, uh, sorry about that. There's nothing there. Um. Case closed. Uh, period. It's a hoax, by the way. Also, now, the public does not believe this. The public is not satisfied. Thomas Massie is not satisfied, and I'm not satisfied either. And I don't think many Americans are. We need to release these files. The fact that we're talking about in this very legislation allowing ice goons to inspect 12 year Olds to unclothe them and check for, uh, purportedly check for, uh, uh, gang tattoos. I mean, 

[11:59:19 AM]

is the Jeffrey Epstein saga alive and well? And if so, who's participating in it? We need those files opened. We need those names exposed. The American people have not forgotten. They will not forget. This is important. And I support the amendments that are coming, uh, on this, uh, bill, uh, the Jeffrey Epstein saga and the Kayla Hamilton act are interrelated. And the relief that our children need is interdependent as well. And so, um, I'm I'm going to, uh, you know, uh, and I'm not going to sit by while folks continuing continue to, uh, cast aspersions on the motivations of the ranking member for leading this effort. And, uh, 

[12:00:20 PM]

with that, I will yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields. 
>> Back, Mr. Speaker, or Mr. 
>> Chairman, I've already given you a title. 
>> Yes. Gentleman from Texas recognized. 
>> Yeah, but my colleague from Georgia, you sat back for four years when Joe Biden was president. I'm curious. And I really do mean this because the ranking member, you read the letter that you were raising hell, uh, back when you were in your position. Will someone and I will yield to you? Will someone answer me? Why? Joe, let me ask you a question first, and I'm going to take my time back. If you don't answer the question because I want the question answered. 
>> I will happily. 
>> Answer, why did Joe Biden not release these files? And why did none of you come out and call for the release of these files when Joe Biden was president? Why did you wait until it became a political issue? If your motivations are so pure, Mr. Goldman? Yes, I'll yield to you. 
>> So first of. 
>> All. 
>> The reason why this has become such a big issue now. 
>> And that wasn't the question. The question was, why did you all not push the Biden admin to 

[12:01:20 PM]

release the files? Why didn't why did not one of you say Joe Biden's justice department should release these files? And if he doesn't, damn it, I'm going to get a discharge petition. So why didn't anyone do that? 
>> I'm trying to answer that. They we were not aware. I think it's safe to say that Donald Trump was in the Epstein files. 
>> I'm not talking about Donald Trump. Everybody in this room knew about Epstein. It was a huge national story. I'm asking you, why did Joe Biden not release the Epstein files? It's irrelevant who may or may not have been in them. Why didn't you care about these victims? Irrespective of the fact that your political opponent could or could not be attached to these files, why weren't you guys calling out the Joe Biden administration to release the files? Please? Someone answer. 
>> I'm trying to answer. 
>> Well, you didn't. I'll let you try. 
>> You got to. 
>> Let Jasmine. Jasmine. And I'll call you by your first name, because we are friends and I feel comfortable. And you call me Lance. So, Jasmine. 

[12:02:21 PM]

>> We are not for. Oh, we are. Do not. Go ahead. Don't ruin my street cred. Uh, no. Here's the thing. I will tell you that at the end of the day, for me as a lawyer, when you have that Maxwell went through her trial in 2021. I believe that's when she was convicted. That is when Joe Biden was in power. After that, she ended up on appeal, which she is currently on appeal now. So as it relates to whether or not that department of justice had even concluded their investigation, I can't say that they had number one. Number two, by releasing the files prior to her going through her appellate process, that may have ended up being an issue that that administration was concerned about. That's number one. Number two. 
>> She's in a pill now. So using that line you're going to pull. 
>> That back. I'm about to get to it because I saw y'all know what I said. No no no. 

[12:03:21 PM]

>> No I'm going to reclaim. 
>> My time. 
>> Since you said we weren't friends, I'm gonna reclaim my time. 
>> Your time belongs to the gentleman. I got. 
>> A real hard time. 
>> At the. 
>> Democrat saying that this is a noble cause. When y'all weren't calling on Joe Biden's justice department to release the files, you're all a bunch of hypocrites to say this is a noble cause because none of you did anything about it. I yield back to the chairman. 
>> Gentlemen, I need time now, Mr. Chair. I need I need time now, since he wanted to be selfish. 
>> Um, I'm. I appreciate, uh. 
>> I move to strike the last word. 
>> Have you used your time? Okay, then I will go to the ranking member. Then we'll come to you and we'll come down the dice. 
>> Okay. Um, we need to clean up some unfinished business. Uh, and let me start with, uh, my friend Mr. Van drew. I understand that was a bit of an embarrassing situation for you to be in, but I want to look to the larger. Oh, well, you accuse us of not seeing anything, and I gave you a letter, and we had a press conference to go with the letter. No. Not yet. I'll come. 

[12:04:22 PM]

I'll come back to you. Okay. But I demonstrated on July 10th, 2019, I sent a letter directly to Jeffrey Epstein, along with chairman Cummings. May he rest in peace demanding that rather, we send it directly to Alex Acosta, demanding that he come in to defend the non-prosecution agreement that he made with Jeffrey Epstein behind closed doors and without consulting a single victim in that case, in total violation of the crime victims rights act. And we demanded that he come in to defend that double crossing agreement where they swept everything under the rug. And we railed about it at the time. Now, you retreated from saying you didn't hear anything from me. I didn't do anything about it to saying, well, I'm speaking more about it now than then. Perhaps you've done some kind of comparative assessment. I'd love to see your statistical analysis of how many words I spoke back then, because I was railing about it back then versus how much I'm speaking about it now. But here's the point. All of this 

[12:05:23 PM]

point, the point you just made, the point Mr. Goodman made is a ridiculous, absurd, and humiliating distraction from the substance. In other words, you guys all agree that it should be released. In fact, uh, you were on, uh, Mr. Massey's bill. You're you're on the bill. So. So you're saying it should be released, but you're upset because you think we're speaking about it more now than we spoke about it during the Biden administration. Give me a break. The Biden administration prosecuted and convicted Maxwell. She went to jail for 20 years. Wait, I'll come back to you. Mr. Van drew. Listen to what I'm saying. You want to whine about the Biden administration? She was prosecuted under the Biden administration. That's why she's in prison now. For 20 years, it wasn't the trump administration. It was the Biden administration. We had every reason, as the distinguished gentlelady from Texas says, to believe that the investigation was still ongoing. And in fact, we learned more about it from Donald Trump, who was, uh, who was Epstein's best friend for more than ten years. 

[12:06:24 PM]

So he said, there's more there. He said, it's all got to be released. All the Republicans were railing about the fact it got be released. We said, we agree. I've been talking about this for six years, and I'm going to enter this into the record. And we had a press release and a press conference to go with it, which I'm going to introduce as well. So don't give me that nonsense about how we didn't care about child sex abuse and human trafficking before. Okay, that's number one. Number two, the trump administration today is dismantling the anti-human trafficking operations of the United States government. Okay, doge wiped out said, which was a very important force in attacking human trafficking networks around the world. They they basically gutted at the us state department, the office to monitor and combat trafficking in persons. Now, you say all of my colleagues say we all hate human trafficking. We're all opposed to the abuse of children. Really? Then work with us to restore all of the funds that have been wiped out 

[12:07:25 PM]

by the trump administration. Can we do that? So this is not just like political games back and forth, which are not going so well for you today. I got to admit, Mr. Van drew, if you just want to point fingers, it's not looking good for your side. Why don't you come aboard and say, let's restore all of the funding that was wiped out from the state department, the office to monitor and combat trafficking in persons, usaid, and all of the law enforcement personnel who have been reassigned from doing human trafficking work to doing the kinds of, uh, immigration raids that have the country, uh, up in an uproar now. And I'm happy to yield to you for, uh, for a second so you can respond to why you mischaracterized my record on this, Mr. 
>> Raskin, thou protest this too much. You only talked about a plea deal in that letter. You never talk that I've seen about releasing the files, period. And let's really get back to the subject. The prosecutions. 
>> This is my time. I reclaim my time. Yeah. The reason for 

[12:08:25 PM]

that is because the prosecutions were ongoing, as I just taught you a second ago, it was the Biden administration's department of justice that brought the prosecution against Ghislaine Maxwell back to you. 
>> This could have been done for years. My point is, and it's consistent, all the moral indignation, all the righteousness, all the speeches, probably many of you have spoken more about it today than you did in your entire career. That's the reality. 
>> You want the file release? Reclaiming my time, Mr. Van drew, I'm happy to yield to you for this purpose. This purpose only. Do you demand the release of the entire Epstein file? The whole world's watching. Do you or do. 
>> You not? I'm a co-sponsor of the bill. Okay. 
>> Will you sign the discharge petition today? 
>> A different issue? 
>> No, I know, that's why I'm asking it. 
>> To you. You go through a proper way. That is proper hurt. Innocent people know proper is going through committee and then going through the process of voting on the floor. That's what I said, that when I co-sponsored it. And I say it now, the bottom line is you're talking about it more than you 

[12:09:27 PM]

ever did. It's political. 
>> Time of the gentleman yield. 
>> I yield back to ranking member. 
>> Does the gentleman from new Jersey seek additional time. 
>> Only just quickly to say and thank you, Mr. Chairman, that what I'm trying to point out is here. Everyone cares about the issue. We in the judiciary committee are going to delve into it, but you're just focusing purely on a political issue and it isn't consistent. I don't see the moral indignation, the moral righteousness, the purity of heart that you're professing to have. And, Mr. Raskin, I think the world of you, you're one of the brightest people. 
>> Mr. Chairman, he already struck the last word. Are you giving him a second? Are we all getting a second? Five minutes? 
>> Um, okay. I did not realize that Mr. Vander already spoke on the bill. We are on the bill. The gentlelady is correct. The gentleman from. 
>> I apologize. 
>> Gentleman from Alabama is recognized to yield to the gentleman from New Jersey. 
>> Mr. Chairman, I yield. 
>> To miss Hageman. Jeff, are you finished? 
>> I simply said, if you analyze this fact by fact, the 

[12:10:29 PM]

reality is that they are in a much different place now than they were before there was a change of presidents. We all want to see the information released and it will be in an appropriate way. I yield back. 
>> I want to yield to. 
>> Mr. Lady from uh, Wyoming is recognized. 
>> Thank you. Say her name. Kayla Hamilton. Say her name Kayla Hamilton. I'm going to go back to referring to the us department of homeland security office of inspector general report. Uh, because that's what this discussion is about. And as the as has already been determined, the issues associated with Jeffrey Epstein are not germane to this bill. So I'm going to focus specifically on what this bill is about and why it is necessary. According to this report, ice did not have accurate or complete addresses for all uacs released or transferred from dhs and HHS custody. Of the 448,820 uacs that ice transferred to HHS office of refugee settlement 

[12:11:31 PM]

from 2019 to 2023, most uacs were released to sponsors according to the joint concept of operations between dhs and HHS. HHS, or Irr, should provide uacs addresses to ice upon release to sponsors at much at multiple enforcement and removable removal operations locations we visited. Meaning the authors of this report, officers noted a recurring concern about receiving incomplete or commercial addresses for uacs instead of residences. For example, Ero officers at one location. Estimated addresses were incorrect. 80% of the time. Let that sink in. The addresses where unaccompanied minors were released by the Biden administration, the addresses were incomplete or incorrect 80% of the time. During one site visit, the audit team and Ero officers attempted to locate two addresses where HHS 

[12:12:33 PM]

frequently released uacs. However, these addresses did not exist in fiscal year 2023, HHS released 34 uacs to these non-existent addresses. Of the 34 uacs released to these two addresses, only two were in immigration proceedings, one of whom subsequently failed to appear in court. Similar to Walter Martinez, who murdered Kayla Hamilton. Finally, ice was not always aware of the location of approximately 600 uacs, whom HHS reported to ice as fleeing HHS. HHS custody from 2019 to 23 one. Uac fled five times in one year. Another uac runaway who admitted to murdering someone in his home country, had an international arrest warrant, and as of August 2024, the uac had not 

[12:13:33 PM]

appeared in court and had not been located, and Ero officials noted a different uac ran away on multiple occasions. Multiple occasions assaulted HHS or our staff, and admitted to being part of a Mexican cartel. Kayla Hamilton was brutally murdered by Walter Walter Xavier Martinez, a uac who was released to a sponsor by HHS before any background checks were completed. It is imperative that we pass this bill. Thank you, Mr. Frye, for bringing it forward. And with that, I yield. 
>> The gentleman. Will the gentlelady yield? 
>> The time belongs to gentleman from Alabama. 
>> Gentleman from Alabama. Yield to the gentleman from South Carolina. 
>> Yes. Go ahead, Mr. Harriet Hageman. 
>> I'm struck by the statistics that you read in the oig report. In that same report, you've seen that 22% of cases that did not even conduct timely safety and well-being, follow up, uh, calls to either the sponsor or to the minor child, as is required by law. Are you aware 

[12:14:34 PM]

of that? 
>> Uh, it's in the report. 
>> You know what's interesting about this, too? And I don't know if you've seen this, uh, but there was a phone call that was initiated by or six months after Mr. Martinez went missing. And the the sponsor stated that the minor was not under her care any further since August of 2022. This was April of 2023. So we're talking seven months after, uh, and that the minor quote left me to be with his brother. He wanted to hang out on the streets and do what he was doing in his home country. Slash getting in trouble on the streets and hanging out with gang members, end quote. Isn't that alarming that our own government can't even identify and find where these children are? With that, I yield back. 
>> Mr. Chair. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike. 
>> The gentleman yields back before the gentleman from new York. I just ask unanimous consent to enter into the record press statement from Thursday, July 2nd, 2020 first. Trump administration, this is the United States attorney's office, southern district of New York. Uh, detailing the 

[12:15:35 PM]

indictment of Ghislaine Maxwell, uh, in federal court that that particular day. Uh, yeah. 
>> Can I have you. 
>> See. 
>> Two you see from the gentleman from Maryland. 
>> This is the the prior reference letter to Alexander Acosta, July 10th, 2019, and a press release to that effect. Also, uh, and then a letter to William Barr also demanding information, December 20th, 2019. 
>> That objection gentlelady from Wyoming recognized for. 
>> I ask unanimous consent to submit into the record the us department of homeland security office of inspector general, final report dated March 25th, 2025. Ice cannot effectively monitor the monitor. The location and status of all unaccompanied alien children after federal custody. 
>> Uh, without objection, the gentleman from New York is now recognized. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let's go through the history of the Epstein files during the Biden administration. This was caused celeb number one for the extreme Maga, right, that there 

[12:16:36 PM]

was some massive conspiracy to hide democratic political involvement in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking ring. It was promoted and perpetuated by Kash Patel and Dan bongino over and over and over again. It is probably the number one conspiracy theory, uh, on the the online Maga right. And it was pushed and pushed and pushed that they had to release the files, they should release the files. And Donald Trump was asked on the campaign trail, should the Jeffrey Epstein files be released? And he said, yes, Donald Trump comes into office. And, uh, Pam Bondi releases a small portion of the Epstein files that had primarily already been public. There's an uproar on the right. 

[12:17:37 PM]

And by many, many members of congress about why the Epstein files were not being released. Pam Bondi says she writes a memo or an email saying that she wants an explanation for why there aren't more files that are released within 24 hours, and that within two weeks she intends to release them. Then the FBI spends tens of thousands of hours going through the files to redact them. Redact obviously, what you would need to redact, which is the identification information and any other information about the victims they that lasts a couple months. All of a sudden it goes quiet, it goes quiet. Suddenly, congresswoman Luna and others who have been pushing so aggressively for the Epstein files to be released, decide 

[12:18:37 PM]

we're going to stay quiet. And all of a sudden they're not released. Well, what do we learn next? Oh, we learn, actually. This whole right wing conspiracy theory is bs. It is bogus. And Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. So now all of a sudden, the Republicans who were so aggressively intent on releasing the Epstein files because they were going to be, uh, at a huge, explosive story about Democrats involved with Jeffrey Epstein are quiet. So the irony of these Republicans accusing the Democrats now of only being interested in this is for political purposes, is so thick that it is almost sucking us into the quicksand. But let's go a step further. Let's go a step further, because now the cover up is 

[12:19:40 PM]

getting so deep and so intense that this committee, which has oversight over the department of justice and would ordinarily be the one that is doing this investigation, is running away from it. Why? Because chairman comer is the useful idiot who will do the cover up for Donald Trump. And what does that mean? Oh, well, now there is an oversight investigation. But you know what they're not asking for. 
>> Those kind of comments. And he knows that, um, this gentleman gentleman is recognized. 
>> Now, the oversight committee is doing an investigation. But you know what they're not asking for? You know what? You did not put in the rule to confirm that investigation. We're not asking for the documents that were used to open the investigation. Who provided the information? They're not asking for witness statements, victim witness 

[12:20:41 PM]

statements. They're not asking for recordings that may exist. They're not asking for any of the evidence that might include Donald Trump. And rather than acknowledge that you're just trying to cover up for Donald Trump's knowledge and involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein scheme, you're trying to accuse us of being interested. And there's one more point that I will say quickly, this conspiracy theory that you pushed for years is bogus. And when it comes out to the American people that it is bogus, then they will know that all of your other conspiracy theories are also bogus, and your credibility is nil. And I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. Gentlelady from Texas is recognized. 
>> Thank you so much. Um, I move to strike. The last words. 
>> Gentlelady is recognized. 
>> And, uh, so a couple of things. My, um, not friend from 

[12:21:43 PM]

Texas, um, specifically cut me off by the time that I wanted to indicate to him a couple of things. One thing y'all have not said thus far, as far as I can tell, is y'all may have amnesia about this mandate. You know, y'all kept talking about how president trump was reelected and it was a mandate. And y'all aren't talking about the campaign promises, the campaign promise that he made. You see, when we had the Democrats out there, we weren't promising anything about the Epstein files. For all I know, our doj was invested in making sure that they could continue to reveal other people that should be held liable. Instead, it was your side that made this a campaign promise. So to now say that we are playing political games when we know that he actually ran on, this is a farce. That's number one. Number two, everyone on this committee and everyone in congress should have an issue with the fact that right now, 

[12:22:43 PM]

we know that Ghislaine Maxwell has not only been transferred out of her housing in Florida, down to somewhere that looks probably a little bit more like mar-a-lago in Texas. But now there are conversations about pardoning her. So I think that the American people should have full transparency about what took place. When you're talking about someone who went in front of a grand jury and was found to have enough information to go forward and indict her, and then she was convicted and then she was given 20 years. Yet the president is in talks about potentially letting a convicted sex offender out. That's number two. Number three, I don't know if any of y'all took the time to sit down with any of these survivors, but let me be clear. These survivors have made it abundantly clear to us that there was cooperation at all levels of government. And they are talking about fake immigration papers. So all for all, and they're talking about 

[12:23:44 PM]

fake modeling agencies. For all we know, there are people that are still embedded in our federal government that allowed for this to take place that were benefiting, profiting from this. So yes, this is relevant to what we're talking about. The fourth thing that I want to say is I'm tired of y'all cherry picking one horrible event, because that's what y'all do. Y'all find one terrible situation that took place, and then you say that person's name and you wear it out and you make it political. The reality is this I got a few names for you if you want to start going through names and you tell me which one of these names you've decided to do any type of legislation behind. We've got Virginia Guthrie, we've got Annie farmer, we've got Maria farmer, we've got Courtney wild, Michelle Licata, Jenna Lisa Jones, Jennifer arroz, Sarah ransome, Shante Davis, Carolyn Adriano. And the reality is that it's our understanding that there may be close to a thousand victims of Epstein, Maxwell and others. So 

[12:24:46 PM]

stop playing these games and acting like you care about one particular situation. You take a situation and then you exploit what has happened to not only that person, but you exploit those families and you make it a game. Stop just throwing a random dead person's name on something for your own political expediency. If you want to start talking about actually solving something, then maybe we should go to the other campaign promises. The ones that allegedly gave y'all a mandate when he said he was going to lower prices on day one. Yet that didn't happen when he said that he was going to be ending wars on day one. Yet that didn't happen where he said that he was going to save the American people. Yet that didn't happen because, as we know, in that big ugly bill that every single one of you voted for except for Mr. Massey, because he seemingly is the only one that's got any sense over there. Y'all voted for that bill, and the last time I checked, it's driving us further into debt while kicking people off of their health care. In addition to making sure that 

[12:25:49 PM]

billionaires, which I would not be surprised if we start to roll out those names and a number of those same billionaires, because these weren't $2. Well, they weren't $2 Johns. That's not what I got from the information. So stop telling us that you care. Show us that you care. Show those survivors that you care. Sign the daggone discharge petition, sit down and hear their stories, and then tell them to their faces that because your leader does not want to talk about this, that is who you have pledged your loyalty to and your fealty to, and you're not going to protect them, and you're not going to protect others that are suffering right now and others that will suffer in the future. And I will yield. 
>> Gentlelady yields back. Gentleman from California is recognized. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It certainly appears that the only time the Democrats are concerned about human trafficking is when they think they can cast salacious and utterly unsubstantiated innuendos against the president. 

[12:26:50 PM]

We remember four years of unsubstantiated innuendos about Russian collusion. All that turned out to be a lie. And this discussion is starting to rhyme. But here's what the Democrats seem not to give a fig about that. During the four years of their open border policies, they admitted an estimated 530,000 unaccompanied alien minors into this country. Now that's about the entire population of the state of Wyoming. Some were gang members claiming to be minors, such as Kayla Hamilton's killer. Others were innocent children placed with poorly vetted sponsors and then abandoned and lost and forgotten. Now, miss Hagerman is, um. Read the shocking revelations in the inspector general's report. Are the Democrats horrified by this abandonment and endangerment of these children? Of course not. They spent four years defending, excusing, and ignoring these 

[12:27:53 PM]

practices. In July 2021, concerned employees at HHS drafted a memo warning that, quote, trafficking was increasing and complaining that the agency had become, quote, one that rewards individuals for making quick releases and not one that rewards individuals for preventing unsafe releases. According to press reports, Becerra told then director Cindy huang that, quote, if she could not increase the number of discharges, he would find somebody who could. Wong resigned a month later. Now, instead of protecting these children until they could be returned safely home, or until their rightful families could be located, the Democrats deliberately circumvented protocols that were designed to protect these children, and they abandoned them to poorly vetted sponsors in the united States. The house judiciary committee estimated last year that roughly 150,000 of these children have now disappeared. They've simply vanished into a 

[12:28:53 PM]

dark underworld of sex and drug trafficking, forced labor, gang activity and crime. Of course, many are not helpless children, but rather teenagers or adults posing as teenagers who themselves present a mortal danger to the public. Mr. Frye's already told the story of the tragic and entirely preventable murder of Kayla Hamilton. Maryland authorities admitted that he had gang tattoos, but the ranking member told us earlier today that we shouldn't even look for them. While the prime suspect in her murder, a Martinez was placed in a foster home with other children and enrolled in a local high school. He since admitted to four murders, two rapes and additional other crimes. Now, that could never have happened if Mr. Frye's bill had been law. What we do know is that in 2021, the Biden administration removed the requirement that all provide biographic and biometric data 

[12:29:53 PM]

for all adult members of a sponsor's household to check for criminal histories. Once again, Mr. Frye's bill would forbid any administration from ever doing that again. Records produced by a whistleblower show that in 2021, HHS disregarded repeated warnings by a case manager about the miss 13 affiliation of one sponsor who was attempting to take custody of two unaccompanied alien children once again. Mr. Frye's bill would assure that that can never happen again. Now, instead of admitting the damage that these policies have done to hundreds of thousands of children that the Biden administration trafficked into this country and then abandoned, the Democrats seem to be doubling down even now, with the tragedy of these policies is becoming graphically clear. The Democrats still defend them, or at least distract from them. Well, next year, Americans will need to consider if they really want to return them to power 

[12:30:54 PM]

and reopen America's borders, to child trafficking and the most dangerous and violent criminal gangs and cartels on the planet. I'll leave that to them and I'll yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. Gentleman from California. 
>> Move to strike. The last word. 
>> Gentleman is recognized. 
>> I have listened to my colleagues in this debate on the Republican side. Ask over and over, why did the Democrats say nothing during the Biden administration? I've heard TV anchors ask. In fact, I was asked this morning the same question. Now, put aside the fact that in 2019, I called on Andrew Acosta to resign because of his connection to the Epstein files, and I wanted to learn more about why Epstein was not prosecuted. Put aside what Mr. Raskin and Mr. Cummings did. Let's just take you at your word that Democrats said nothing. Is that a reason 

[12:31:55 PM]

for you to do nothing? I don't understand the logic here that because you think the Democrats did nothing on the Epstein files in the Biden administration, that to own the libs, you now have license to leave sexual assault victims unprotected. It's just crazy that you hate the Democrats so much that you would let the most notorious child sex trafficker and the people connected to him not be held accountable because you want to own the libs. Let's just take you at your word. Okay. The Democrats did nothing. So you're going to do nothing is what you are telling me. The Democrats, of course, did not do nothing. But let me boil it down to a lesson that I have right in front of me every morning when a six year old wakes me up around 545 and wants to watch the same movie over and over and over, that's frozen. And there's a lesson in 

[12:32:56 PM]

this film, uh, where Elsa is told by one of the trolls in the movie that if you can't see the future, all you can do is the next right thing. And having seen this again 100 times in the last couple of years, my takeaway is if you don't know what's going to happen next and you can't change the past, all you can do is the next right thing. So even if you are right that the Democrats did nothing in the past, wouldn't the next right thing be to sign the discharge petition? Or are you so obsessed with just scoring political points that you would punish sexual assault victims? Is that who you are? I don't think that's who you are. When I listen to some of the legislation you proposed on your side, I do believe sincerely you care about victims. And if that's who you are and you care about victims, sign the damn discharge 

[12:33:57 PM]

petition. Okay? You can own us. I don't care. You can own us a thousand times. If it gets us to 218 signatures, I will let you have whatever victory you think you're accomplishing. But it seems to me that you're more interested in telling me not to believe my own eyes, which is what the president is doing. The president is telling us not to believe our own eyes. And it's not just on the Epstein files and the birthday card. And by the way, guys, we can bring in a handwriting expert. But I have two eyes. And I know what that man's obnoxious signature looks like. And so do you. But Donald Trump has told us that he would end all wars on day one, that prices would plummet and jobs would soar. And where are we? Ukraine has never been weaker. We've never seen more jobs lost in America 

[12:34:58 PM]

since Donald Trump was last president. Even conservatives are complaining about how expensive grocery prices are, and even his own health. He's trying to trying to tell us not to believe his own, our own eyes. Joe Biden looks like an olympic athlete compared to a man who is hiding his illness. Donald Trump is a broken man who has broke his promises. And if we don't start checking him, we are going to be a broken country. So, my friends, if you sincerely believe that Democrats drop the ball and did not do enough under the Biden administration, then join us now in doing the next right thing and sign the discharge petition. Otherwise, you're telling sexual assault victims this is just about scoring political points and they come last. I yield back. 
>> The gentleman yield. 
>> I yield. Yes, I yield to the 

[12:35:59 PM]

ranking member. 
>> I just to add to your very eloquent statement there, it seems like these days every accusation is a confession. So the accusation is the Democrats have somehow changed their position. We've been opposed to child sex trafficking all along. We spoke out against it. I've introduced evidence to that effect. It's our friends across the aisle have changed their position. They wanted to see the release of the Epstein files. Now that Donald Trump changed his mind, they've changed their mind. Thank you for yielding. 
>> I would just, uh, claim five minutes. I would just point to the subpoena that chairman comer sent on August 5th of this year. I'm just going to read it now. Frankly, I'd ask you. I'll ask unanimous consent to put it in the record here in schedule to subpoena in accordance with the attached schedule instructions. You, the honorable Pamela J. Bondi, in your capacity as attorney general of the United States, are required to produce the following documents and communications that are in your possession, custody or control in unredacted form, except for redactions. To protect the personally identifiable information of any victims for any child sex abuse material as 

[12:37:00 PM]

defined by the department of justice manual or any other redactions required by law. And then there are seven seven sections here. Number one, all documents and communications relating or referring to Mr. Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, and further relating to or referring to trafficking, exploitation of minors, sexual abuse or related activity. Number two, all documents and communications contained within the case file regarding united States versus Jeffrey Epstein. Number three, all documents and communications contained within the case file regarding united States versus Ghislaine Maxwell. Number four, all documents and communications contained within the file pertaining to the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein by the us attorney's office for the southern district of Florida that resulted in the 2007 non-prosecution agreement between the us attorney for the southern district of Florida, Mr. Epstein. So this would answer what Mr. Raskin, I think has raised, uh, real questions about multiple times in today's hearing. Number five, all documents and communications relating are referring to the United States versus Jeffrey 

[12:38:00 PM]

Epstein, United States versus Ghislaine Maxwell, and the investigation of Mr. Epstein that resulted in the 2007 non-prosecution agreement between the us attorney for the southern district of Florida and Mr. Epstein. Uh, again, answering, I think getting to the information that Mr. Raskin seeks, all documents, number six, all documents, communications between the executive office of the president, including executive office of president Joseph Biden Jr. And the department of justice, relating to or referring to the United States versus Jeffrey Epstein, united States versus Ghislaine Maxwell, and the investigation of Mr. Jeffrey Epstein that resulted in the 2007 non-prosecution agreement between the us attorney for the southern district of Florida, Mr. Epstein, and, number seven, all documents and communications relating to referring to the death of Mr. Jeffrey Epstein. So seven seven different bullet points. Every single one starts with the word all. I think the gentleman from New York earlier said that this wouldn't get the documents that started it. Yes it would. It's covers everything. And that oversight committee has subpoenaed all that information and it's coming in. I think there's 

[12:39:01 PM]

30,000 pages coming in, but it's a rolling product. This is the typical the way it works. We've done a lot of investigations around here. It's always a rolling production. So I think we're going to get the material. Its oversight committee is doing it. It's unfortunate that Mr. Goldman made the comments he did about the very fine chairman of the oversight committee, but he is getting the information that the American people asked for and that many members had demanded for a long time, including members on the Democrat side. So I'd ask unanimous consent that be entered into the record. Who seeks recognition? 
>> I have an amendment at the desk. 
>> Gentleman from south Carolina is recognized, and then we'll come to the gentlelady for her amendment. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to be clear about what we just heard a few minutes ago from miss Crockett from Texas, that we are doing a bill on some, quote, random dead person. This person was a vibrant soul, had a life, was pursuing a degree. She's not some random dead person, but she's a symptom of a larger problem, 

[12:40:01 PM]

which you guys have ignored for years, which is that we're going to import and fling open the Gates of our southern border and allow these individuals to come into this country, that we're not going to vet them, that we're not going to, uh, ascertain about where they land and that we're not even going to follow up. The gentlelady from Wyoming introduced into the record a homeland security report. There's a health and human services report about all of the systemic failures of the last administration and the flippant and, quite frankly, callous response by the gentlelady from Texas is that she's just some random dead girl. Now, she just walked out of the room. So I guess she didn't want to hear this, but her mother, if you want to talk, if you want to talk to her mother, which I encourage you to do so that you understand who she was. Here's a quote from her mother that she was texting with me. Kayla talked a mile a minute like a 

[12:41:01 PM]

hummingbird. She loved animals, especially her cat, oreo. She cared about the homeless. She loved her mommy. She treasured her family and friends. She loved god and loved going to church. She loved her birthday and Christmas. She loved the beach and the pool and swimming. Her voice and laugh carried across the room even when the room was quiet. She loved music and loved to have fun. She lived every day to the fullest and boy did that girl love to sleep. And I go can go on and on. This was a young lady who was pursuing a degree as a veterinarian. She wanted to help people. She wanted to live her life. She wasn't some random dead person that we just plucked out of a hat. She is a she is a symptom of a larger problem that you have ignored. We had a field hearing my first term in congress. Not a single damn Democrat showed up to look at the open border lawlessness caused by this administration. So while you sit here quietly for the last four years, when Joe Biden and Kamala Harris allowed and tacitly sanctioned the trafficking of hundreds of 

[12:42:01 PM]

thousands of children across the border, I think it's pretty shameful. You said nothing while young girls and boys were raped and otherwise abused by their smugglers and traffickers, you didn't even raise a finger to help when the New York Times, of all places, not really a bastion of conservatism, exposed the labor trafficking of unaccompanied minor children, there were no consequences to the actions of the last administration. And you just buried your heads in the sand. So Kayla Hamilton wasn't a random dead person. She was one of many people who have been victimized by the lawless border problems created by the last administration, and you refuse to acknowledge it. And that's shameful. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. Gentlelady from Texas, I believe, seeks recognition. Gentlelady is recognized. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk. 
>> Uh. 
>> For the. 
>> Amendment to the amendment. 
>> And Wisconsin reserves a point of order. Nature will be considered as read. The gentlelady is recognized to 

[12:43:01 PM]

explain her amendment. 
>> My amendment today would strike the provision of this bill that would require the secretary of health and human services, who we know is incompetent to conduct body examination examinations of unaccompanied children aged 12 and over to see if they have gang markings. I don't know what your obsession is subjecting kids to government mandated strip searches, but it needs to stop now. I want y'all to take a second and really think what you're trying to force little kids to go through. This has to be the third time y'all have tried to push a bill that would give the federal government legal authority to put kids in compromising, traumatizing situations, whether it's immigrant kids or trans kids. Every chance you get, it seems like you want to force the government to look at little kids bodies. Now, let me put this differently. You want to give some stranger a federal government employee, no less. For all of you small government folks over there on the other side of the aisle, free rein to examine little sixth or seventh graders for some obscure thing 

[12:44:02 PM]

that isn't even conclusive evidence that they're in a gang. I mean, this is kind of insane. This provision is just another example of the hypocrisy coming from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Y'all love to talk a big game when it comes to protecting kids from harm and trauma, but the fact is, it's all an act. Because if Republicans really cared, y'all wouldn't be refusing to release the Epstein files and bring justice to the victims of human trafficking and assault. And I do want to make sure that I put a little asterisk here. Everyone is talking about how great comber is doing and this and that. To be clear, it was an oversight subcommittee, and it was the Democrat who is the ranking member who actually brought the motion to release the files. It just so happened that there were enough Republicans on that subcommittee, seemingly more than on this full committee, that had the courage enough to actually vote with the Democrats. But let me be clear. This was Democrats leading. 

[12:45:03 PM]

This was the tail wagging the dog. So I don't want y'all to forget that part. Don't go around claiming that y'all are the heroes, because now they're supposedly files that are coming out. It was the Democrats that led that. Just to be clear now, you sure as hell wouldn't be forcing kids who are in middle school into situations where the federal government is placing them in a room with a random adult strip, searching them to try to find some obscure, amorphous thing. Now, I know some of my Republican colleagues here have kids, and I'm willing to bet that if your kid was going to say England and you found out some random government employee over there was going to strip search your kid to look for some tattoos or markings, you would lose your damn mind. You do everything you could to prevent this from happening and save them from that trauma. And that's all I'm asking you to do today is to protect these kids, spare these kids from the unnecessary trauma. Be the adults in the room today because enough is enough. Nothing in my amendment prevents dhs or even HHS from 

[12:46:04 PM]

requesting a kid's criminal record, or prevents HHS from evaluating whether kids are a danger to themselves or others with this amendment. Does do, however, is prevent kids from having to go through unnecessary strip searches and be traumatized for the rest of their lives. If you're really on the side of history, if you really want to be on the right side of history, then that means that you'll do all that you can to protect kids. And I urge you to support my amendment. The final thing that I will say. Is I stand by everything that I said before. Y'all love to cherry pick because you claim that the immigrants are the reason for crime, but you have nothing to say about white supremacists in this country. I don't remember, as we are headed to yet a record number of school shootings in this country as it relates to children. I don't remember y'all bringing bills in the names of any of these itty bitty children. In fact, the most recent shooting as 

[12:47:05 PM]

y'all love to send thoughts and prayers. These babies were legitimately praying when they were killed. So I don't remember y'all trying to do gun reform for all of that. I don't remember y'all being super outraged when it came to January 6th. And those defendants, well over a thousand defendants, and we're talking about they beat up on law enforcement. Now, y'all love law enforcement. You love some ice. Now that ice is going around thugging everywhere. But nevertheless, I don't remember y'all even having the courage to say yes. Put the damn plaque up that was signed into law. Y'all won't even do that. So don't tell me that y'all are here being the champions for everybody. You are very selective. So yes, it is a game because if I want to do legislation, I don't have to put somebody's name on it to do right. I don't have to put one of the children's names so that I can have real gun reform and save lives, and I will yield. 
>> Gentlelady yields back. The 

[12:48:05 PM]

gentleman withdraws his point of order. The gentleman from South Carolina is recognized to speak on the amendment. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In fact, I think you should. If you stand by it, I think you should probably apologize to the mother and the family of the one that you called a random dead girl. I think that would be appropriate. But let's be clear about something right now. Uh, while the the member from Texas is busy filming tik Tok videos and dancing around the halls of congress, maybe it would be prudent to know that we already do medical evaluations of uacs when they come in the country. All we're asking in this bill is that you say, hey, that looks like a tattoo. Is that a gang tattoo? There's no material change other than that is a tattoo. That's a gang tattoo. And if we had done that, if we had done that, Kayla would still be alive. You know the random dead girl that you just called out, Kayla Hamilton is her name. She would still be alive. So time and time again, our Democrat colleagues seem to be more interested in defending illegal aliens, including dangerous criminals, than American citizens. The Democrats say we 

[12:49:05 PM]

can't use our common sense and place children with gang tattoos in secure placements. I call bs and I think the American people do. If a teenager in HHS custody has an Ms. 13 tattooed across his or her forehead, why should HHS have to wait to find out more information? They shouldn't secure placements aren't medieval prisons, as the Democrats are making them out to be. These are safe facilities designed precisely for the purpose of housing juveniles who may present a danger to themselves or to others. I would also remind my colleagues that the provisions in this bill have no bearing on the basis for a uacs potential for removal from the country. The bill simply says that while a uacs immigration proceedings play out in court, if the us uac has obvious markings that are gang affiliated, maybe they should be housed with other children, or maybe they shouldn't be housed with other children and set free into our American communities. This is 

[12:50:06 PM]

just simply common sense. And as we know, when aliens are in a secure facility for the pendency of their immigration proceedings, these proceedings do not drag on for years, but can be concluded quickly within a matter of weeks. I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment. I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. Gentleman from Florida is recognized. 
>> Mr. Chairman, uh, thank you. And because his name was invoked and I want to lock arms with you on this, Mr. Chairman, um, you know, because our our together, dear, close personal friend, our our resident Nancy drew and drama queen connoisseur, James comer. I'm not going to stand here while people drag his good name through the mud, okay? Not going to let it happen. Okay? We all know the good work that he has been doing and oversight that clearly. 
>> What the gentleman just for a second I was referring to the derogatory word that your 

[12:51:08 PM]

colleague, our colleague from New York, used for Mr. Comer that, you know, that's not appropriate. Everyone in the committee knows that's not appropriate. And we shouldn't have that kind of language. And I'm here to proceed. 
>> And I'm here to defend him as by far the best investigator of all time in the capitol, which is exactly why all of his investigations, which have used, you know, Chinese informants that were prosecuted and Russian disinformation people from prison, I mean, he the main thing he was tasked with last year. Right, which was the Biden impeachment, that that we had a vote. Oh, no, we never had a vote on that because of course, he didn't find any evidence. So this morning, uh, our close personal friend, uh, Mr. Comer, said that he was not going to look into the letter or the doodle. Uh, the president's doodle. He's a decent doodler, by the way. Um, so he wasn't going to look into whether the signature was a forgery. And I'm concerned about that because this is the 

[12:52:09 PM]

president of the United States. If there are forgeries or forgeries out there, I think we should investigate it. And in fact, this document is 22 years old. So you're telling me someone 22 years ago went back to the future and forged his signature when he was a Democrat, and somehow this person was no damos knew he would become a Republican, become president 22 years later. So, listen, I submit to you that we can solve this problem for the American people. You don't have to take my word for it. You don't have to take our dear personal friend Mr. Comer's word for it. Uh, let's bring in a signature expert. You guys pick the witnesses, bring in your signature experts, swear them under oath, and let's have the signature examined. Is it his or. It is not his. We don't have to play games. Or. You know, the president says it's not his. We say it's him. No, no. Let's bring in a signature expert, a 

[12:53:10 PM]

referee, because we can't agree on anything, even when it's right in our face. Um, of whether that is indeed the president's signature or if it's a forgery, we should immediately open up an investigation into this forgery. I think that's. 
>> What the gentleman yield. 
>> I will absolutely yield to my esteemed ranking member, Mr. Raskin. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Moskowitz, for this point. I know that the president of United States brought a $10 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street journal for reporting about the existence of this. He denied that it existed in any way. What is the state of that litigation, I think? Wouldn't we want that resolved before we move to a handwriting expert? 
>> Sure. I mean, I assume there will be obviously depositions that get taken. I assume there will be production of documents. I assume as that case goes forward, they too will bring in their own expert to say it is not him. I just think, you know, because we're in the middle of this investigation and in oversight, even though, of 

[12:54:11 PM]

course, this committee has jurisdiction over the doj and the and the FBI. But I we all know that our chairman obviously only wants to handle, you know, the real stuff we give everything else to comer. Um, and so, you know, I just think that rather than this drag out for weeks or months, is it his? Is it not his? Does he like to draw? Doesn't he like to draw? Right. Like, let's just get an expert in here to tell us and listen. I'll tell you right now, if you bring in an expert, you pick the expert, you swear an oath. If that expert tells us it's not his signature, I will accept. I will accept the results. I will absolutely accept the results. That it's not his signature. And it. And it is absolutely a forgery. But I'm willing to bet that we won't do that. I'm willing to bet we won't do that. But prove me wrong. I yield back. 
>> Mr. Chairman, I. 
>> Yield back. The gentleman from New York is recognized. 
>> Mr. Chairman. Uh, I've been listening with very with great interest to this debate, and I just have a couple of comments 

[12:55:11 PM]

on some of the things that have been said before. I'm not I don't remember in detail who said them, but, uh, let me refer first of all to someone who talked about the Russia hoax. The Russia hoax was not a hoax. It was true. And the report of the Mueller report showed that it was true. And not only did the Mueller report show that it was true, but Donald Trump said it was true. What else did he say when he got up during the 2016 campaign and say, Russia, if you're listening, if you're listening, let me have the, uh, the, the Clinton emails. That's one comment. The other comment is more to the point on this bill. This bill says if they have a gang, uh, tattoo. Well, the fact is, we don't know what gang tattoos are unless it says in somebody's forehead. Ms. 13 repeatedly. People have been arrested or sent to, uh, Seacat 

[12:56:14 PM]

in El Salvador to be detained for life and tortured because they had a soccer team logo on their tattooed or for other, uh, things, tattooed. Uh, people assume our government authority. Some of them, the trump administration seems to assume that they know what gang tattoos are, but the fact is they don't. And we've seen repeated mistakes. And, uh, no one should rely on tattoos. If you think someone has committed a crime or someone is a member of a criminal gang, prove it. Prove it in a court of law. Don't just assume it because of a tattoo, which is evidenced by itself of nothing. I yield back, I yield back. 
>> The gentleman. Yield. 
>> Gentleman. 
>> Thank you kindly. I just want to pick up on your point about the Russia hoax matter, because I think that the deployment of this phrase conflates two very different things. One is whether Vladimir 

[12:57:16 PM]

Putin commanded his internet research agency to engage in a systematic effort to, uh, surveil and destabilize in the United States of America and a bunch of other countries, too. That is absolutely proven. It was proven in a bipartisan senate committee report. The senate intelligence committee report was proven by 17 or 18 of our own intelligence agencies, although Donald Trump refused to accept it. Um, and there were actually people who went to jail for that. So anybody who thinks that the Russia hoax means that Russia was not involved in trying to, uh, affect the 2016 election, just as it did in the subsequent elections. You're wrong. You're flat out wrong in your contradicted by the facts. So it's the other issue, the question of collusion, which of course, is not even a legal concept or the question of conspiracy. 
>> There's certainly. 
>> No conspiracy shown between Donald Trump and his 

[12:58:16 PM]

lieutenants and the Russians. There were lots of meetings shown. That's in the Mueller report as, uh, the former chair of the judiciary committee just pointed out, there were tons of meetings that took place, and there were various people within the trump hemisphere who actually went to jail for lying about their contacts with the Russians. So don't cover that up. And Mueller identified all of those, but he could not find, he said, evidence of an actual conspiracy that took place. That's very different from saying everything is a Russia hoax in that language is really Russian propaganda that you're falling into. If you use that. Vladimir Putin is an enemy of freedom and democracy, as the people of Ukraine know, as the people of the United States know. And nobody should be out there saying poor Vladimir Putin, the victim of the Russia hoax. And now we're getting the same language from Donald Trump saying that that Epstein file, which he was demanding the release of, is a Democrat hoax. Well, if it's a Democrat hoax, he invented it. He made it up. 

[12:59:17 PM]

But it's not a hoax. That's why Ghislaine Maxwell is in prison. For 20 years, she was convicted of felony child sex offenses, running a child sex ring, and the idea that the president United States is running around now calling it a democratic hoax is appalling. And I think it should make anybody who's using that language of a Russia hoax think twice about that, because you can see exactly what he's doing there. He's trying to sweep under the rug this massive international child sex ring, uh, simply because his name has appeared in the files that were scrutinized by FBI agents. And we know they were busy redacting, uh, and so on. But that language is just propaganda. That's pure polemics and has nothing to do with the search for the truth. I thank the gentleman. 
>> For my time. It's very clear, then, the Russia hoax and what was was, uh, what. 
>> He said the Democrat hoax? 
>> No, I said the so-called Russia hoax was not a hoax. 

[1:00:19 PM]

There was proven collusion. And there is proven. 
>> The time is. 
>> Collusion here with the Epstein files, and I yield back. 
>> The Mueller report said just the opposite. The Mueller report said no collusion, no coordination, no no conspiracy whatsoever. No one saying Putin some victim or good guy. Quite the opposite, frankly. But maybe, maybe, maybe the Democrats haven't paid attention to what the director of national intelligence released seven weeks ago were. A whistleblower has come forward and said the report got changed in December of 2016, and we'll have ample opportunity next week to question the FBI director on that and a host of other issues. But they changed the underlying intelligence used to do the president's daily brief and the intelligence community assessment. That's what the director of national intelligence, I would point out, a former Democrat member of the United States congress released seven weeks ago. So this idea that, you know, that that somehow he was the president was working, president trump 

[1:01:20 PM]

was working. It's just ridiculous. They changed it. It said one thing. Yeah, Russia tried to impact the they tried to meddle around the election. They do that all the time. But there was nothing that they did. The intelligence didn't support any type of work with with president trump or his campaign. Quite the quite the opposite. Because remember what they did, remember what they did. The Clinton campaign hired the law firm Perkins coie, who hired the public relations firm fusion gps, who then hired a foreigner who then wrote down a bunch of baloney that became the dossier and that was used to go to the FISA court to start this whole thing. They changed the report. We'll get a chance to talk about that next Wednesday, when we have the director of the FBI here who seeks recognition. The question occurs on, oh, I'm sorry, John Lee from California. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, you know, I wanted to I want to respond to the amendment, but, you know, the ranking member talked about all of this Russian information, as did the 

[1:02:20 PM]

member from New York. Well, you know, one of the reasons why we are getting, um, Russian, uh, propaganda and misinformation and probably why we will continue to be fed red lies, is because we have defunded the very departments that combat misinformation coming from Russia and coming from China. Now, we actually have no guardrails up to help make sure that the American people are not being fed these red lies. And to the comments made before about how, you know, Democrats are politicizing all of this, and now we care. And I don't I can't even remember. It was actually the acting deputy chief of a justice department unit who said on hidden camera that the government should redact every Republican from the Epstein client list and leave any democratic names. Now, obviously, the man walked it 

[1:03:20 PM]

back. You know, once it was revealed that he said this on hidden camera. But you know who's fooling who here? Uh, you know, I want to go back to this amendment, which is really troubling. Um, because nowhere in the text does it define what a gang tattoo is and what constitutes a gang tattoo. That would be subject that decision, that definition would be subject to every yokel local who may or may not have an ax to grind. You know, it is really capricious and arbitrary because what could a gang tattoo look like? Would it be a kkk? Would it be aj6? Would it be an Maga? Would it be H or Aryan brotherhood? Would it be olympic rings? Would it be an afia? Would it be a star of 

[1:04:21 PM]

David? I think if you're going to say in law. That you want someone to detect what a gang tattoo is, you should properly define it and then make sure that those folks have proper training so that they know how to define what a gang tattoo is. And so you want people. To randomly, I don't know, select a child 12 years old that's like somebody's child, somebody's grandchild. So you're going to have a 12 year old boy or girl be yanked. And according to this bill, they're not even a 12 year old girl or boy. They are an unaccompanied alien child. So I was like, what does that et? But you would. You're talking about an unaccompanied alien child, that you would then pull them out because you see some sort of tattoo on them, and then you say, well, that person looks dangerous. I'm going to say, 

[1:05:22 PM]

that's a gang tattoo, and then you're going to subject them to a cavity exam. So I want to know who would be the people physically inspecting these 12 year old boys and girls conducting cavity exams on these children? And I would be really concerned if you have folks with a penchant for liking to do that, always raising their hands to say, I'm going to conduct the cavity exam of the 12 and 13 year old child, because essentially what this bill is saying is that you want to sanction child exploitation and assault at the federal level. And I have to tell you, this actually goes on now in many instances. And those kinds of cavity exams of 12 and 13 year old boys and girls is a pretext for molestation. So we would be deputizing individuals. With, you know, a predilection for 

[1:06:25 PM]

kiddy porn or I don't know what nastiness, nasty behavior and saying, okay, yank some child out of a line, grab them, and then physically inspect them and go all up in everywhere. That's not about protecting folks. That's really essentially what we're talking about when we're talking about what Jeffrey Epstein and his people were doing. So I support this amendment because we should be having a real conversation about what's in this bill and recognizing that it is running tandem, running tandem with what folks are trying to cover up by, by continuing to deny the importance and the release of the Epstein files. And with that, I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. Gentleman is recognized. Gentleman. Gentleman yields the gentleman from South Carolina. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I don't really know where this hyperbole is coming from about 

[1:07:25 PM]

cavity searches or whatever. I mean, that's just like absolutely ridiculous statement. This is about ascertaining whether a tattoo is on somebody that is a gang affiliation. And miss Camilla dove wasn't in the room earlier when we talked about this, but we already do medical inspections of unaccompanied children when they come into the country. All we're saying is that the medical examiner or the person looking at this child says, you know what, you've got Ms. 13 tattooed across your forehead. Maybe that's a troubling sign, right? Maybe that's a bad thing to release to a sponsor who half the time we don't even know who they are and we don't do the follow up calls. The HHS inspector general report. 
>> The gentleman yield. 
>> No, I will not. The inspector general report says 22% of cases or did not even conduct timely safety, well-being, follow up calls and an 18% of cases. The follow up 

[1:08:25 PM]

calls weren't even documented in the children's case file. So all we're saying is that when you do this, that you should also look to see if there have a gang affiliation that you should also call their country of origin. Do you know how we found out that Kayla Hamilton's murderer was a gang member? Because the local cop, not the federal police, not HHS or or a local cop called down there and said, hey, we've got this kid. Does he have any prior arrest records? They said, oh yeah, he's a member of Ms. 13. We should be doing this on the front end and not releasing these individuals to sketchy people in the country so that they can go wreak havoc. I mean, it's alarming to me, if you look at this note that eight months after he left his sponsor, eight months after he left his sponsor, then the federal government gets involved and says like, oh, 

[1:09:27 PM]

yeah, well, the sponsor says that he hasn't been there for eight months. 
>> The gentleman yield now. 
>> No, I will not I will not yield. That's that's alarming. So when these children get processed through as they do under existing law, all we're saying is that, hey, if they've got tattoos and they're gang affiliated tattoos, maybe don't put them in American streets pending the outcome of their of their court hearing. Maybe we should put them in a secure facility until we can really ascertain who this individual is and why they're here in the country. Because if we did that, if we would do things like that and have a little bit of damn common sense in this country, maybe we wouldn't have more. Kayla Hamilton's in the world who lost their lives. Maybe we would be a little bit smarter about who we're bringing into the country. With that. Mr. Chairman. 
>> The gentleman yield now. 
>> Mr. 
>> The gentleman from Washington, gentleman from 

[1:10:27 PM]

Washington, controls the time. Mr. Baumgartner. Mr. Baumgartner, gentleman from Washington. 
>> Senator. 
>> You control the time. Gentleman yields back. All right. Yeah. The, uh the question occurs. Oh, I'm sorry, you got the gentleman from Georgia. I'm sorry. Gentleman from Georgia is recognized. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And then once again, I'd like to just kind of go back to the remarks that were made by my colleague from from California. I mean, all of this verbiage, everything that we're talking about, there's no definition as to what any of these signs look like. So I'm in agreement with her. But I'd like to yield the balance of my time to the good, our good member from Texas, as she is able to defend her amendment and I yield. 
>> Thank you so much to the gentlelady from Georgia. I do want to be clear, because words matter, especially as lawmakers. Um, and in reading this, to be clear on page four, and if we look at line four, the actual language of the bill says that 

[1:11:29 PM]

HHS will conduct an examination of the unaccompanied alien child. It does not say that there will be a denotation because there are already, um, examinations that have taken place. It says that they will conduct an examination. So if the intent is just to document what is seen in a medical examination, then I think that we should consider amending this so that we are doing what you intend to do under the legislative intent, instead of having sloppy language that does allow for us to sit here and disagree about what we're reading. And as a trained attorney, I am telling you that the word says conduct. It does not say to denote what is already going on. So I do want to be clear that that language may cause a problem as it relates to HHS, because it looks like they have an additional thing that they are to do, and then there are no 

[1:12:30 PM]

limitations that are placed on this examination, nor are there any parameters for what it is that they are looking for. And again, I have concerns about the competency of HHS under its current leadership, as well as we should be talking about the fact that if you are really trying to do right, and this isn't about cherry picking, I do want to point out that we do have some work that we could do as it relates to immigration. Let's look at the fact that right now, under the current leadership, it seems like there's a current theme of failure under this particular administration. But we are on track right now to have more deaths in custody as relates to immigrants. Now, what does that mean? That means that there is a failure somewhere. Yet I've yet to see one bill that lists one of those persons names who has died in custody. And to be clear, it's not one. It's 15. So far, we have already exceeded the number of 

[1:13:30 PM]

fatalities in custody as it relates to ice from the entirety of 2024, when we had Joe Biden in office. In addition to that, if we are talking about we really want to make sure that we are protecting people, and that's what this bill is about. It's because the immigrants are coming in and they are the ones they are causing all the crime, and they are the reason for everything that is going wrong in the United States. I can point you to the over 1500 defendants that were charged as it relates to January 6th. Now, if it wasn't good enough that they went through and they ended up with convictions, and then your leader came in on day one and decided that he wanted to pardon them. I would like to enter, for the record, a unanimous consent. Unanimous consent. Okay. 
>> No, you state your state what it is, then. 
>> At least ten. Pardon? Insurrectionists face other criminal charges. This is from citizens for ethics. 
>> Without objection. 
>> All right. Now, if we wanted to talk about some of those 

[1:14:30 PM]

crimes that they have committed, we've got child porn. We've got a murder plot, we've got reckless homicide. I don't remember any of you coming out and saying, Mr. President, this maybe was not a good idea to release these people. I don't recall any of you proposing a bill. 
>> Will the gentlelady yield? 
>> Yes, I will. 
>> I mean, on the logic that the majority presents today, the president of the united States would be responsible for all those crimes because had they not been freed, those crimes would not have happened. Right? 
>> That is absolutely correct. 
>> Thank you. 
>> It's absolutely correct. So I would like to yield to anybody from the majority, if you have anything to say about the fact that it is documented that these people, after being convicted, it was your leader that decided to release them, and we have documentation of them not going out and committing small crimes. We're talking about big crimes. Y'all ain't got nothing to say about that, though, huh? No, because you want to continue to have a 

[1:15:33 PM]

government that goes out and preys on vulnerable people that have decided that they wanted to come to what we said was the land of opportunity, and to seek a better life. Instead, you are okay with and you are pushing a rhetoric that says that is all right to go out. And because someone is of a darker complexion, because someone does not. 
>> The time of the gentlelady. 
>> Has an accent. 
>> Time of the gentlelady has expired. Um, gentlelady yields back to the gentlelady from Georgia yields back. The question occurs on the amendment offered by.

Because of the ans that the committee just adopted amends more than just the William wilberforce trafficking victims protection reauthorization act of 2008. The long title of the bill needs to be updated to reflect that fact. This amendment does not change the substance of anything that the committee just debated or voted on.

H.R. 43. The bill will be considered as read and open to amendment at any point. The 

[1:24:52 PM]

chair now recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. Fry, for an opening statement. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. H.R. 4323, the trafficking survivors relief act is a strong, bipartisan, bicameral piece of legislation that will help our most vulnerable populations. This legislation passed committee last congress via voice vote, and I'm looking forward to seeing it pass again today. Human trafficking, specifically sex trafficking, is a heinous crime that tragically continues to grow in America and around the world. While international sex trafficking may be more widely known, domestic sex trafficking also persists in the united States. Traffickers even use social media to lure innocent people to become victims. Human trafficking can occur anywhere. Women and children who make the dangerous journey to cross the southern border into the united States have a high likelihood of being trafficked. A study by the coalition against trafficking in women estimated that 60% of unaccompanied alien 

[1:25:52 PM]

children are exploited by cartels or smugglers for for child pornography and drug trafficking in the united States, and adult or child can be trafficked and exploited at hotels, truck stops, in their homes, and online trafficking victims are exploited in cities, suburban and rural areas. It can happen any time and anywhere. Efforts by federal, state, and local law enforcement and advocates to eliminate human trafficking and support victims have increased awareness, reporting, and prosecution of sex traffickers across the country. However, victims of these crimes are also sometimes initially charged with the crime themselves. Traffickers use force, fraud, and coercion to induce their victims to commit these crimes. This can lead to the arrest, conviction, and incarceration of of trafficked victims without consideration of their victim status. Thankfully, we as a country have made significant progress to help victims and survivors move forward with their lives. The vast majority of states provide some sort of relief to 

[1:26:54 PM]

victims for nonviolent offenses committed while under the control of their traffickers. I think 47 states have something very similar, if not exactly the same, as this bill. These laws allow victims to move on from these horrors, reenter their communities, and get on with their lives. My home state of South Carolina continues to lead on this forward, victim centered approach. The trafficking survivors relief act follows the state's clear lead and provides federal relief to survivors of human trafficking who committed a nonviolent offense as a direct result of having been a victim of human trafficking. For a court to grant a motion to vacate a conviction or expunge an arrest, a defendant must show that the offense was committed as a direct result of having been a victim of human trafficking, to ensure that these opportunities are only available to true victims of trafficking and not perpetrators themselves, leaders of the bill worked hard, hand in hand with law enforcement, to enact appropriate safeguards for the bill. This legislation allows for additional evidence to be 

[1:27:54 PM]

considered, including the sworn testimony of a law enforcement officer as to whether a victim had any role in coercing other victims into criminal offenses. This bill would restore trafficking victims and reintegrate them into their families and communities, while making sure that law enforcement and the courts can protect the public safety. This legislation is endorsed by advocacy organizations, faith based organizations, the law enforcement community. Last congress, multiple attorneys general wrote in strong support of trafficking survivors relief act. Simply put, this legislation strikes the right balance between victims rights and public safety. Let's work together to fight back against the evils of human trafficking, and help victims and survivors move forward with their lives. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
>> Ranking members recognized for an opening statement. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, thank you to the distinguished gentleman for his statement. Um, please. We're marking up the bipartisan trafficking survivors relief act, a bill 

[1:28:55 PM]

which is going to provide relief to victims and survivors of human trafficking who themselves have been unjustly targeted and criminalized as a result of their involvement in trafficking as victims. We have been pushing for nearly a decade to make this relief available at the federal level. Um, and I'm delighted that we're able to work together on a bipartisan basis, and I look forward to its swift passage. But America, Mr. Chairman, is going to be wondering how we can pass a bill today called the trafficking survivors relief act when we turn a blind eye and a cold shoulder to the trafficking survivors who came to Washington, D.C. Last week to demand the complete comprehensive release of the Epstein files, it's not going to make any sense to America. In fact, it's going to look like we're trying, um, to cover up for the cover up that's taking place of the Epstein files. You kw, the 

[1:29:56 PM]

administration, uh, moved unilaterally to get, uh, Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein's, uh, coconspirator partner in sex crime, moved from her prison in Florida to a minimum security prison nicknamed club fed in Texas. This shocked the Epstein survivors, who came to Washington last week and said this blatantly preferential treatment of Maxwell, which may border on witness tampering, was, quote, the justice system failing victims right before our eyes. But this isn't just about Jeffrey Epstein or Glenn Maxwell. I mean, who's being protected by the members of congress who refuse to sign on to the discharge petition? By the way, um, we have a new member of congress today from, 

[1:30:57 PM]

uh, Virginia who has, uh, just come to join us, and he's adding his name to the discharge petition. That means any one of my colleagues on the Republican side can be the deciding signature on the discharge petition. You can take a stand and be a profile in courage, at least in standing up against Donald Trump. It's not really a profile in political courage, because the vast majority of the American people want to see it. But I guess these days, standing up against Donald Trump is what qualifies as political courage in Lincoln's party. But look who's being protected if you don't sign it. Well, all of those who abused children right alongside Jeffrey Epstein, all of his unnamed, unidentified coconspirators who were protected by Alex Acosta's original corrupt bargain immunity agreement. All those people are being protected by your silence, your passivity. All of the banks like deutsche 

[1:31:58 PM]

Bank, which allowed, facilitated and, um, failed to report the transactions that allowed this massive child trafficking ring to proceed. Millions and millions of dollars moving around the country to give to the girls, to cover it up, to pay people off. And then the modeling agencies that were used as a big cover story to traffic and abuse these children. That's who's being protected by your complicity with this new plot. After Donald Trump performed a u-turn and decided, no, he didn't want Epstein files out anymore. But that's not all, because this administration has been systematically dismantling 25 years worth of bipartisan progress made in combating trafficking and in protecting the victims and survivors, all while claiming they're making America safe again. But they're 

[1:32:59 PM]

starving. The offices and programs of funding and of staffing, um, and they've made it much harder to prosecute child traffickers and sex offenders. In February, the doj's office on violence against women removed all information on funding opportunities against human trafficking from the website. In April, the doj's office of justice programs terminated hundreds of grants awarded to state and local law enforcement, defunding the police and nonprofit groups that help survivors of sexual and domestic violence take the hope and healing survivor resource center, based in the in the chairman's beautiful home state of Ohio, um hope and healing provides emergency shelter, crisis services and support to survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking, including women like Casey, a state owned mom who found a loaded pistol and two shotguns hidden in her house just days after her husband sexually assaulted her. Hope and healing was able to 

[1:33:59 PM]

get Casey and her kids out of the house and helped her to land on her feet. Federal grants make up 7,575% of that group's budget. Losing that funding would force hope and healing to fire their staff, including court advocates who help survivors navigate the legal system. This is going on throughout the federal government. They are gutting the anti-human trafficking programs. So leaving aside all of the political finger pointing back and forth, and who got there first to denounce child sex trafficking and so on, let's leave that. Let's leave that to the side. Why don't we get together and say that we are going to work together to restore all of the funding and all the programs that have been gutted by the trump administration so far? And we'll have more to say about exactly how that's happening. I'm glad to see congress is going to act to support victims and survivors in this bill. I urge my colleagues to support it, but I would also encourage all of our colleagues across the aisle to join committee 

[1:35:00 PM]

Democrats to ensure that the federal government is doing whatever it can to empower the survivors and the victims of sex trafficking, I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. Without objection, all other opening statements will be included in the record. Chair now recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina to offer an amendment in the nature of a substitute. 
>> Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment on the desk. 
>> Report the amendment. 
>> Amendment in the nature of. 
>> Objection, the amendment, the nature of substitute, be considered as read, and shall be considered base text for the purpose of amendment. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina to explain the amendment. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This amendment simply makes a small change to the short title that does nothing to alter the substance of the bill. I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. 
>> What is the. 
>> Mr. 
>> The gentlelady from Georgia. Then we'll come to Vermont. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. I move to strike the last word. 
>> Gentleman is recognized. 
>> Thank you. H.R. 4323, the trafficking survivors relief act is critical, bipartisan legislation that would provide long overdue relief to victims 

[1:36:02 PM]

and survivors of human trafficking to help them overcome the lasting effects of being trafficked and to allow them a chance to heal. This bill recognizes their unique vulnerabilities, vulnerabilities, and challenges they face and seeks to ensure that they can rebuild their lives and move forward. Victims of trafficking are demeaned, dehumanized, and coerced by their traffickers who do not see them as people, but as objects to be bought, sold, and abused. But we see them, and we must give them the help that they need as a direct result of being forced to participate in criminal behavior, trafficking survivors can end up with criminal records that have serious and long lasting consequences. However, far, however far survivors may get from their traffickers, the records follow them, making it hard to find a job, pursue an education, find a safe place to live, or even get treatment for 

[1:37:03 PM]

the trauma that they have escaped, the barriers they face as a result of their records often serve as a constant reminder of their trauma, and often force them back into the clutches of their traffickers. Many states, including my home state of Georgia, have already passed laws like H.R. 4323. It's past time that we take similar steps at the federal level. Survivors agree. A woman who was trafficked for over a decade said, and I quote, during that time, I was forced by my trafficker by threat, intimidation and physical harm to commit many crimes. Since that time, I spent almost 20 years with my criminal record determining where I could go, where I could live, what jobs I could obtain. No victim of trafficking deserves to have to live with the consequences of the actions they had no choice in committing for the rest of their lives. End quote. And I 

[1:38:05 PM]

think we would all agree that this is simply unfair, allowing survivors of human trafficking to expunge their arrest records or vacate nonviolent convictions related to their exploitation is essential to the restoration. For these survivors, the opportunity to clear their records is a chance to overcome their victim mission and to pursue a better future for themselves and for their families. This bill takes a meaningful step towards achieving justice and healing for those whose lives have been disrupted by these horrific crimes. This legislation makes clear to victims and survivors that we stand with them, and that we are committed to helping them overcome many challenges that they face daily, just as we must allow them the ability to shed the lasting remnants of their victimization, we must also provide them with the resources and services that they desperately need. That is why we must insist that the trump administration work with 

[1:39:05 PM]

us and not against us. Instead of helping victims and survivors, this administration has prioritized the interests of people who commit sex crimes, made it easier and safer and more profitable to commit human trafficking offenses. It has decimated said, the agency that prepares the congressionally mandated trafficking in persons report and fights human trafficking abroad and diminish the manpower and effectiveness of agencies, including hrc, that focus on combating traffickers here at home. In less than a year, this administration has destroyed 25 years of work done by Democrats and Republicans to protect victims and survivors, prevent trafficking, and prosecute those who would dare place another human being into modern bondage. I am more than pleased that we are marking up this bill today. It's about time. I hope that this has 

[1:40:07 PM]

brought this will be brought swiftly to the floor and then to the senate for action, so that this important measure becomes law quickly. But I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting victims and survivors in every way. I thank Russell fry and Johnson for championing this important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it. And I yield back. Um, excuse me, um, Mr. Chair, I have unanimous, unanimous, unanimous request, uh, from survivors and coalition letters of support. Uh, I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a letter from world without exploitation, signed by 168 survivors from more than 41 states, writing. I also ask unanimous consent to enter into the record a letter from a coalition of 80 non-governmental organizations and anti-trafficking letters leaders who support the trafficking survivors relief act. 
>> Objection. 
>> And also, finally, I ask unanimous request to consent and consent to enter into the 

[1:41:09 PM]

record a letter from miss Carrie Alice Robinson, CEO of catholic charities usa, expressing support for this piece of legislation. 
>> Without objection. 
>> Thank you. 
>> I yield back the gentlelady from Florida, gentlelady from Vermont is recognized. Recognize you I make. 
>> Okay, okay. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Uh, I first want to thank the members of the committee who. 
>> Have spent time to move this much needed legislation forward, and I will, of course, be supporting it. Uh, trafficking survivors deserve a federal legal pathway to clear the record. And many states like Vermont, my home state, has already taken these steps. And I'm glad that finally, on the federal level, we see that there has to be a tool for survivors to remove convictions from the record. So I am grateful that we're working in a bipartisan manner. And the effort is rightly focused on the victims. But, you know, I've been sitting here for 

[1:42:11 PM]

hours and a couple times I actually just had to leave because sometimes it feels in here like it's a game and we're trying to one up each other and just looking around the room earlier. 1 in 5 women in this country are going to experience sexual abuse or rape in their lifetime. That means members of the committee, members of the staff, members of the public, members of the press who have been in here continue to struggle with their experiences. And we heard from the victims last week who said, what we want is for people to listen to us, to listen to our stories. And it was a bipartisan group of women, and there were Republican women who showed real courage on that day, who stood up in front of cameras and in front of the press and said, it isn't about politics 

[1:43:12 PM]

or one upping each other. It's about our lives. And we sit in this committee and we forget. People watch what we do here girls, teenagers, women who have been abused, they watch what we do here and they watch to see if we are taking their experiences seriously. And it's shocking to me with every little bit of information that comes out about what was in that birthday book. Let's just look at the birthday book that was released this week. Those men knew exactly what was going on and they condoned it. Powerful men were protecting powerful men and it continues to go on in congress. Powerful people are protecting powerful people. And I don't care where the evidence goes. These women deserve to have all of the information released, not just what the committee down the hall decides is going to be 

[1:44:14 PM]

released. They deserve to have everything into the light of day, to have the sunlight be shown. And we have a responsibility to stand up for those women. And, you know, I was sitting here looking at all of our records in terms of like, how many of us have kids? And on that side of the aisle, I counted 50 kids and over ten grandkids. I know if I did the same count over here, I'd get a similar outcome. If you are not willing to risk anything as a member of congress, if you are not willing to risk your seat, then you are not brave. Courage takes actually risking something, and it took real courage for those people to stand up last week and say to the president of the united States, come down here. We are not a hoax. Our experiences are 

[1:45:14 PM]

not a hoax. And every time you say it, it is a hurtful thing to us. So if you can't do it, if you can't do it, it says something about your willingness to show real courage in this job. Every day I wake up and I walk towards this building and I say, I will never, ever think, what if I lose my seat over this vote? What if I lose my donor support? What if the president does not stand with me? Again, if you're not risking something, then you are not showing courage, and I. I can't believe that we just need one more vote. Now with this member coming, we need one more person, one more signature. All it says is release all of the information and let's see where it takes us. I think we owe these women this, especially after the raw deal 

[1:46:14 PM]

they got from Acosta. Let's try to make it right here. And I hope and pray that someday you do not need to look into the eyes of your kids when they realize you did not stand with the victims. I yield back. 
>> Gentlelady yields back. Question occurs. A question occurs on the adoption of the amendment in the nature of a substitute. This will be followed immediately by a vote on favorably reported the bill. All those in favor say aye. Aye. Those opposed? 
>> No no. 
>> Oh, no. 
>> I retract. 
>> My no. 
>> Yes. 
>> That's called a double negative. 
>> It was. 
>> Which means which means a positive. Right. 
>> Yeah, yeah. 
>> Uh, in the opinion of the chair, the ayes have it. The amendment the nature of substitute is adopted. The question is now on favorably reporting the bill as amended. All those in favor say aye. Aye. Those opposed. No. The ayes have it. The bill is ordered to be reported favorably to the house. Members will have two 

[1:47:14 PM]

days to submit views. Without objection, the bill will be reported as a single amendment in the nature of a substitute. Incorporating all adopted amendments, and staff is authorized to make technical and conforming changes. 
>> Good, good. Sorry for the state 36. Okay. 

[1:48:19 PM]

Maybe more. He's coming. 
>> Committee will just be at ease for a minute or two as we wait for the sponsor of the bill, Mr. Issa, to arrive. 
>> I just don't. 

[1:50:47 PM]

>> Susan. Notice I call up H.R. 3770, the firearm act, for purposes of markup and move that the committee reported favorably to the house. The clerk will report the bill. 
>> H.R. Three. 
>> Objection. The bill will be considered as read and open for amendment at any point. The chair now recognizes the sponsor of the legislation. The gentleman from California, Mr. Issa, for his opening statement. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In June of 2021, president Biden, uh, or whoever was running the white house doj at the time adopted a zero tolerance policy to revoke federal firearms license, or ffl license from those who commit willful violations of the law. And although that seems reasonable, in fact, it wasn't. They didn't mean falsifying records or failing to maintain records needed for successful firearm tracing. The new classification allowed for and caused the ATF to revoke the license of ffls, who, for the simplest technical 

[1:51:48 PM]

failure, sort of not dotting an eye, not just figuratively but somewhat literally, was sufficient to revoke licenses. In 2021, the ATF revoked only five licenses, while in 2024 it rose to 195, the highest in over two decades. My firearm firearm act will put to an end this weaponization the ATF and empower ffls to self report minor technical changes, so to speak. The dot the period or the misspelling of a name and other trivial violations that the ATF, uh, is usually in fact more than willing to over to, uh, not put somebody out of business over but has been forced to by the existing, uh, directive. Additionally, the bill gives canceled ffls a path 

[1:52:49 PM]

to apply for a new license that that if in fact, they can show they were denied reasonable due process and their failures were minimal. Well, president trump rescinded Biden's ATF's anti-gun policy this year. The firearm act is a permanent solution needed to protect the sacred rights of people to keep bear and, yes, purchased weapons. I urge my colleagues to support this sensible technical correction, and I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. The gentleman from Maryland is recognized for his opening statement. 
>> Mr. Chairman. Thank you. Um, two weeks ago, gunfire tore through the annunciation catholic church in Minnesota, disrupting a mass during the first week of the school year. Two children, Fletcher Merkel, eight years old, and Harper Markowski, ten years old, were shot and killed in this act of grotesque mass gun violence. 21 other people were injured. This was one of nearly 300 mass 

[1:53:50 PM]

shootings that have occurred so far this year. We've lost more than 10,000 Americans to gun violence so far this year, not counting people who took their own lives. This is our first markup since this latest horror. But instead of addressing our nationwide gun violence crisis with a universal, violent criminal background check supported by more than 90% of the American people, the committee is advancing a bill to let gun dealers stay in business even when they break the law. Under the Biden administration, the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives focused on enforcing the law against one of the greatest threats to public safety gun dealers who willfully put guns in the hands of violent criminals. It's a very small percentage of the gun dealers. These are the bad apple gun dealers. Well, when president trump took office, that changed. The overwhelming majority of good apple gun dealers in America had no problem operating in an 

[1:54:50 PM]

environment that focused on the most dangerous offenders. In fact, just 5% of gun dealers are responsible for 90% of recovered crime guns. But the trump administration swiftly repealed the Biden era strategy and invited the gun dealers who lost their licenses to reapply. You heard that right. Trump is putting law breaking gun dealers back in business. This move is a boon to the criminals who rely on the bad apple gun dealers as a source of guns that can be diverted to the black market, where they can be trafficked and used to commit more crimes. The irony is hard to miss, trump says. There's a crime wave so out of control that he wants to occupy our cities with the military, violating our entire historical prohibition on the use of the military for law enforcement purposes, embodied in the comic, the posse comitatus act. And he wants to blast the drug cartels out of international waters. 

[1:55:50 PM]

But his own policies make it much easier for drug cartels, gangs and gun traffickers to get the guns in the first place. The guns that are fueling the drug wars and gang violence. So now our colleagues want to double down on this dangerously incoherent strategy. The bill would effectively grant amnesty to licensees who have willfully violated the law, and are a disproportionate and significant source of crime guns, for example, the bill grants dealers amnesty for willfully violating the law if they report their violation to ATF before ATF discovers it. There are no time limits for self-reporting, so licensee might intentionally break the law for months or for years, skipping background checks completely or lying on forms hoped to avoid inspection and then self-report. On the day an ATF investigator arrives. Under this bill, that criminal enterprise would face no consequences. That's quite a 

[1:56:51 PM]

deal. It's like you've got the power to go and rob a bank. And the minute the police show up at your door, if you say, oh, I robbed a bank and you give it back, then there are no consequences for you. Another amnesty provision requires ATF to wait 30 business days before bringing any kind of enforcement action, giving dealers the chance to correct violations. The 30 day waiting period doesn't begin until ATF gives the licensee actual notice of the violation, including a detailed explanation of the violation and all the evidence that ATF has in support of revocation. This means, again, a licensee could willfully and repeatedly break the law. Wait until ATF learns of the violations, wait to learn exactly which violations ATF discovered and what the evidence is, and then correct only the violations listed in the notice. That's quite a deal for lawbreakers. The bill is designed to stop enforcement actions before they begin, by requiring ATF to go above and beyond the 

[1:57:52 PM]

willfulness requirement. That's already the law under the ATF would have to prove not just willfulness, but also deliberate planning or specific intent. And willfulness cannot be inferred from prior conduct. In other words, it's not enough to know that a corrupt gun dealer is breaking the law. ATF would also have to show how the corrupt gun dealer planned to break the law before they can stop the dealer from selling more guns on the black market. The bill also creates a presumption that, quote, minor clerical or curable conduct is not willful. Under the statute. This clerical exceptional loan could make it all but impossible to enforce our gun laws, since many of the licensee's obligations involve precisely creating and maintaining specific records of gun sales. The bill also allows gun dealers to stay in business while they challenge the revocation in court, no matter the risks they pose to the public. Finally, this bill seeks to upend the past work of ATF by allowing bad gun dealers who just lost their licenses to 

[1:58:54 PM]

reapply under more lenient standards. ATF agents and investigators work to keep guns out of dangerous hands, and to prevent corrupt gun dealers from putting the public at risk by arming criminals and gangs. This bill is a slap in the face not only to ATF, but also to the state and local officers who work with ATF to disrupt gun trafficking networks, trace guns to their source, and prevent violent crime. The bill would force ATF to turn a blind eye to those who are breaking the law and putting American lives and communities at risk. It would force federal law enforcement to fight gun violence with their hands tied behind their backs. We should be investing in ATF and supporting their work. Often I hear from my colleagues, we don't need new laws. We just need to enforce the laws. We've got this. This legislation would make it impossible to enforce a lot of those laws. But this bill is a part of a broader trend moving everything in the wrong direction. Republicans are gutting ATF's budget. They're firing ATF staff, and they're reversing 

[1:59:55 PM]

the gun violence prevention prevention work that has contributed to record low murder rates in cities across the country. The irony, of course, of the deployment of us military forces in the national guaragainst our cities is the murder rates have been going down because of effective work that was done with the Biden administration and the mayors. We should have a nationwide summit, federal, state, local, working together to talk about what's working, not deploying our military forces against our people. That's why we had a revolution against the king, because the king deployed military forces against the people in the colonies. So let's continue the real serious work that's taking place in cities and states. Let's build on those successes. But let's not take a huge step backwards with this Swiss cheese legislation. It's all holes. It's all about gaping loopholes, introducing them into the law. I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. The 

[2:00:55 PM]

gentleman from California is recognized. Excuse me. Without objection. All of the opening statements will be included in the record. The chair now recognizes gentleman from California for an amendment in the nature of a substitute. 
>> Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. 
>> Report amendment in the nature. 
>> Objection. The amendment substitute be considered as read, and shall be considered base text for the purposes of amendment. The chair now recognize the gentleman from California. Explain the amendment. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is simply a minor technical corrections, but I have to make a more significant technical correction. My colleague, uh, ranking member apparently is reading a different bill than the version that we put out, and I would appreciate if he would please look again. Nothing in this bill would cause someone who has been allowed to buy a weapon that should not have bought a weapon because of a failure, an incorrect, or in a legal act by an ffl. In no way, shape or form does this bill consider that minor or allow them to reapply. So when we 

[2:01:56 PM]

talk about people who got guns, who shouldn't have gotten guns from ffls that are not doing their job, nothing in this bill and nothing on either side of the aisle is intended on those people continuing to be able to sell weapons. Uh, the fact is, we do define it as minor technical, and we do recognize that just as the ranking member can correct his tax filing before the irs discovers he's made a mistake and avoid any kind of a willfulness, this is the same thing. And by the way, the word willfulness is important because if it is willful, no matter how minor, in fact, it is not protected. Uh, the the changes in this, in the technical correction are minor, but the core bill remains the same. One that is intended to deal with the comma, the dot, the inadvertent, uh, failure to put in a middle initial or a middle name, 

[2:02:57 PM]

putting something in the wrong line, things that happen every day in this lengthy and unfortunately not well, uh, automated system that we operate on today. So I do share with the gentleman the desire that we we call out gun violence. We call out the terrible things that have happened, including last week. But this bill was drafted before that. It was put out there because of a need to make permanent a standard that everyone would appreciate being able to live under, which is it's not a gotcha game on. It's a get them to do the job well. And that's the reason this bill does just that encourages the proper behavior. And if there's a technical correction holds harmless the self-reporting. So in fact, they can, uh, be more accurate and we can all live in a safer world. With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. Gentlelady from Georgia is 

[2:03:59 PM]

recognized. 
>> Did you want to. 
>> Gentlelady from Texas is recognized. And I'll come to the gentlelady from Georgia. Did you have a okay. 
>> Okay, sir. 
>> Uh, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an amendment at the desk. 
>> Clerk will report. 
>> Reserve a point of order. 
>> Point of order. In reserve. The gentleman from California. 
>> Bob good. 
>> Amendment to the amendment. 
>> Objection will be considered as read. The gentlelady from Texas is recognized to explain her amendment. 
>> My amendment today would create an additional exemption under the bill's self reporting section, whereby if a firearm is transferred to a person and that firearm is used and results in the death of or injury to law enforcement, the licensee may not use the self reporting process. Let's be honest about what's really going on here with this self reporting process. This provision isn't about public safety, and it sure as hell isn't about accountability. 

[2:05:00 PM]

It's about a get out of jail free card, plain and simple. Under this provision, licensees will now be able to say, yes, we messed up, we had a violation. But because we're telling you about it, we don't have to face any consequences. Now, because of how this bill text is written, a licensee could willfully violate the law, for example, by willfully falsifying a firearms transaction form using a fake buyer name, then report that violation to ATF and not face any real accountability at all because of the self-reporting. Now, let me tell y'all, when these violations happen in the real world, innocent people die. People get serious, life changing injuries. Families get destroyed. And it's not just everyday citizens. It's also our law enforcement officers, folks who put their lives on the line every single day to protect our communities. Now, look, there's a lot we could do. We could be doing to actually address gun violence in this country. We could pass laws 

[2:06:00 PM]

creating stronger background checks. We could pass gun storage laws. We could pass wait time requirements. But instead we're here pushing a bill that gives licensees a get out of jail free card with a pat on the back, all because they admitted they did something wrong after the damage has already been done. It's not right now before my colleagues try to mischaracterize my amendment and twist my words, I want to be very clear. Nothing in my amendment automatically revokes or denies the renewal of someone's license. What this amendment does is ensure the attorney general still has the authority to decide whether the licensees actions, as it pertains to the violation, warrants denying or revoking their license when that firearm is transferred, is used, and results in injury or death of a law enforcement officer. This is about accountability. This is about letting the process play out. So if you care about law enforcement, if you believe we shouldn't let licensees whose violations result in injury or deaths of law 

[2:07:00 PM]

enforcement be exempt from certain punishment, punishment that the attorney general would still be required to decide whether or not it's warranted. Then I urge you to support my amendment. 
>> Gentlelady yields back. Gentleman from California is recognized. 
>> Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I believe that it is, although probably well intended, it misses the mark. And if all of us would look on page two, line eight, the term, uh, parentheses 41. The term uncorrectable violation means any violation that, despite best efforts, cannot be corrected by the licensee, including a violation in which the licensee transferred a firearm to a prohibited person. It already covers the sending to a wrongful person. What the amendment would, would potentially not potentially would clearly allow for is a perfectly legitimate sale with 

[2:08:02 PM]

absolutely no wrongdoing by the ffl and initially no wrongdoing by the individual. That later leads to an adverse effect would, in fact can be considered. Quote uncorrectable. So although I know the intent was good, I would ask that this be defeated in favor of the existing language. Page two. Line eight through 11. And with that, I have no more to say, and I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. Gentlelady from Georgia is recognized. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I move to strike. The last word. 
>> Is recognized. 
>> Thank you. Just before labor day weekend, eight year old Fletcher Merkel and ten year old Harper Majewski had just begun a new school year and were attending a morning mass at annunciation catholic church. They had their whole lives ahead of them. But instead of planning labor day outings or their futures, their parents had to plan their funerals. Fletcher Harper, their 

[2:09:04 PM]

schoolmates and teachers became the latest victims in yet another mass shooting, a uniquely American crisis where this year alone, 874 children and teens have died from gun violence. I'm going to read this again. 874 children and teens have died this year from unacceptable gun violence, the leading cause of death in this country for our children. We should be convening today to take action to keep our children and all Americans safe from gun violence, instead of making it harder for the ATF to do its job. As 130 of my colleagues and I pointed out in a letter that we sent to speaker Johnson last week, the gun violence prevention task force has introduced legislation to expand background checks, keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people, and ensure our communities are safe. Our 

[2:10:06 PM]

Republican colleagues refuse to join us to pass this common sense legislation. My Republican colleagues wouldn't even stand against this administration's cut of 108 $158 million of funding for gun violence prevention evidence based programs that have reduced gun violence in red states and blue states. Although the grants had already been awarded to organizations, my Republican colleagues have done nothing to make sure that this life saving work continues. But here we are, an all too familiar scenes. Instead of addressing the nationwide gun violence epidemic with common sense, effective solutions, my colleagues offer very stale thoughts and prayers, and American people are tired of it. To the ever growing number of victims that we have every single day. Bring us together. I mean those kinds of victims 

[2:11:07 PM]

and things that are happening that brings us together to hamstring the ATF and the work that they do that is so vital. The firearm act would create procedural hurdles that will give a path to gun dealers who are actually violating the law. Alarmingly, it would allow dealers who challenge their revocations to continue to operate, even if that means more illegal guns are sold. It would also allow dealers who already lost their licenses to reapply under a new, lower standard. Take a dealer like arrowhead, pawn and jewelry in my home state of Georgia. Washington post investigation found that between 2006 and 2010, over 1700 crime guns were traced back to arrowhead, making it the fifth largest source of crime guns in the country at that time. Although the NYPD previously identified it as the top out-of-state supplier for the city's crime guns. A gun traced back to 

[2:12:08 PM]

arrowhead was used to kill two NYPD police officers in 2014. Despite receiving numerous citations and warnings from the ATF over the years, arrowhead only stopped selling guns after the Biden administration implemented its zero tolerance tolerance policy. It ultimately closed down because the ATF was empowered to crack down on rogue gun dealers and revoke their licenses when they egregiously violated federal law. Under this bill, a seller like arrowhead could obtain a new license and resume operation. Every day, we are losing more than 100 Americans to gun violence. That's 100 more than 100 lives that are lost and gone unnecessarily. We should be talking about bills like the bipartisan background checks act of 2025 that would establish universal background checks for firearm purchases, a 

[2:13:11 PM]

policy supported by over 90% of the American people. Or my assault weapons ban that was supported by previous Republican administrations. And it actually saved lives. We should all be able to agree that guns should be kept out of the hands of criminals, and that the few federally licensed gun dealers that do not follow the law should be held accountable and put out of business. I oppose this legislation. I hope to be able to amend this legislation, but at this point, I encourage my colleagues to oppose it as well. And I yield back. 
>> Gentlelady yields back. Who seeks recognition? Gentleman from Georgia. 
>> Thank you, mister chairman. Um, you know, we we have the gun show loophole, which is actually just a loophole in the law that allows for unlicensed gun dealers to stand beside, uh, licensed gun dealers and sell 

[2:14:11 PM]

as many firearms as the licensed gun dealer. And, um, and so that's the gun show loophole or the unlicensed gun dealer loophole. And here we should really rename this legislation, uh, the licensed gun dealer loophole act. Uh, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3770 and in support of the, uh, Crockett amendment. Uh, last year, there were 16,576 firearm deaths, not including suicides and 5151 children and teenagers who were shot. And just last month in Atlanta, a man fired more than 180 shots, actually 500 shots, 180, uh, penetrated the glass, but he fired over 500 shots with a 

[2:15:11 PM]

long gun at the headquarters of the centers for disease control and prevention. Given all this, we need licensed gun dealers to do their part to prevent guns from being sold to people who should not and cannot legally have them. To prevent gun trafficking and to enable law enforcement to trace guns that are involved in crimes. Yet this bill would let licensed gun dealers off the hook, allowing them to operate without any guardrails on who they can sell a gun to and where the gun goes. This bill grants amnesty to licensed gun dealers who willfully violate the law in multiple ways. First, it would narrow the definition of willfulness so that previous bad conduct cannot be used to infer intent on the part of the gun dealers. Second, this bill would allow firearm licensees to break the law until they get 

[2:16:13 PM]

caught and then change their tactics long enough to keep their license, knowing that there will be no consequences for their illegal acts. And I know that, uh, it's difficult for some in the audience to hear maybe not those on TV, because we got a lot of chatter going on around here. But third, this bill creates an amnesty provision for self-reported violations. If it is theoretically possible for the licensee to correct in the future, allowing them to keep their license, whether or not they actually correct their behavior. Also, this bill would make it impossible to enforce a licensee's obligations involving creating and maintaining records of gun sales, which are very important for tracing. And finally, this bill creates a paradox where the standard is higher to get an initial firearm federal 

[2:17:14 PM]

firearm license than it is to get another federal firearms license after your first one was revoked for breaking the law. That makes no sense. And it endangers the public health. And therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. Support the amendment, but vote against the bill and I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. Gentleman from North Carolina is recognized. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
>> Mr. Issa, I have a question for you. And after hearing the summations from the other side of the aisle, I think there is a relevant point of clarification here. Um, as someone who knows many in the gun business, uh, I think it's a safe characterization, an accurate characterization to say that the Biden administration utilized the bureaucratic might of the executive branch to, uh, really in a, in a roundabout way, put gun stores out of business. And they used the regulatory authority, they had to put undue burdens, undue harassment 

[2:18:14 PM]

on gun stores for paperwork violations. Essentially, whether it was mislabeling a, a serial number, filing the wrong registration, the wrong place, something minor. And I want to be very clear here, the previous congressman, in his summation, he said that there would be an amnesty for criminal conduct. And I've read your bill. I think that is a gross mischaracterization, but it essentially is. I read it, it protects against undue burdens and harassment from the executive branch on small businesses. And so I yield you the balance of my time. But I think that this bill is being grossly mislabeled by the other side of the aisle. And I ask for your clarification. 
>> I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I couldn't agree more that, um, their misunderstanding seems to be continuing. Uh, one of the points being that minor, although not defined in some specific way, it is by exclusion defined. For example, on page four, when it speaks to those things that cannot be 

[2:19:17 PM]

excluded, it says on beginning on line 13, on page four, the attorney general may not bring enforcement actions. Blah blah blah, unless the violation involves a prohibited transfer of firearm or under other uncorrectable violation that creates direct or acute risk, not just loss of life, but risk or death or serious bodily injury as a result of the uncorrectable violation. That's a very interesting way. Pursuant to the language that's already in the law, it makes it clear those are the things you can't correct if you put the gun in the wrong person's hand because you've sold to someone that isn't supposed to have it, it's not correctable. On the other hand, if you accidentally claim something is a long rifle and it's a shotgun, even though you put the right serial number in, you can recognize the mistake and correct it. And you said it very, very well. And I think you're both your your legal background, but also your small business experience helps us understand these are 

[2:20:19 PM]

paperwork intensive transfers. Selling a weapon has been made, a pile of paperwork and small mistakes do happen. Uh, just as they happen with federal workers, especially if they're using paper. This simply says you put the the dot in the wrong place. You make another minor correction. You can in fact self-correct, but in no way, shape or form according to the body of the existing, uh, bill, can you correct something that even could lead to bodily injury, much less to the actual transfer? That does lead to it? And I appreciate the gentleman clarifying. 
>> May I ask one more question in this way, the bill also establishes an incentive to police your own paperwork to make sure that it's accurate, to make sure that errors are being corrected. And that's the part that I think is being so grossly misrepresented here. You are encouraging the business owner to get it right. 
>> I couldn't agree with you more. The fact is, if it doesn't get caught in the first audit, it's really only the individual ffl that's going to 

[2:21:21 PM]

realize that perhaps they put the wrong part number, the wrong, uh, nomenclature or anything else of that sort which they can correct, which helps makes the records complete. And when you're looking to trace back a weapon that may be used at a later time or even is stolen, it is critical that it be accurate. And this encourages that kind of behavior. 
>> Thank you sir. 
>> Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. The ranking member is recognized. 
>> Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to pursue that line of questioning. Our colleague from North Carolina just initiated. Um, first of all, um, Mr. Issa, this is, um, I think very dramatic legislation which introduces a rather dramatic principle, which is that people who violate the law should be given 30 days to correct their action, and then everything's going to be all right. And I just wonder, would you pursue this in another context, like say, take for example, the internal revenue service? Um, a lot of 

[2:22:22 PM]

people make paperwork mistakes there as you're describing them. All of it is paperwork in some sense. Um, but we also know a lot of people, uh, a lot of corporations certainly are cheating on taxes. Should they be given, um, actual notice of the violation, and then 30 days within which they can go in and self-report, and then they're held clear of their violation, which essentially what you're doing. 
>> The gentleman would yield. 
>> Yeah. 
>> I couldn't agree with you more that that's a perfect example. If, in fact, a corporation makes a mistake, they are normally shown. And if it's not willful, normally there are no punitive benefits requirements. You do pay your taxes. Ultimately, this legislation actually does exactly what you're hoping for, which is it sets a standard that if it's willful, it is not correctable. If it's willful, it does not get a pass. It must not be willful in order to have the correction be. 
>> Aren't you requiring something more than willfulness? 

[2:23:23 PM]

You're requiring planning to be shown. Well. 
>> We we actually know we we, uh, we set a standard that, uh, that if it's willful, it's willful. Now, how you determine willfulness. Uh. 
>> That's the current standard. I thought you were adding this idea that the government's got to show that there was actual planning that went into the violation. 
>> Well, in order to. And I appreciate the gentleman, if you'd further yield, willfulness has to be sought as to what occurred. That causes someone to say willful. And we're in no way, shape or form wanting to make that more difficult, but to simply say it's willful because there's a mistake isn't the same as saying it's willful. And here's why we say it was willful. All right, well. 
>> You know, I'm going to ask my staff to go back and check that because I read it as saying, this new planning standard is what applies in that mere willfulness is not enough. But let me ask you about another part of it, which is the self-reporting requirement. As I understand it, what this does is say, so say I'm the, uh, a licensed gun 

[2:24:24 PM]

dealer, and I'm not one of the good apples, which is 95%. I'm one of the bad apples. And so a friend comes in and says, will you sell me these, uh, uh, assault weapons? Um, and then, um, I say, yeah, you know, I'm supposed to do a background check on you, but I'm going to let you go. You're my friend. I know you're a you're a good guy or whatever. Um, and I know you've got some misdemeanors. I don't know if they would create a problem for you or not. I'm just going to let you go now, under the amendment, uh, the amendment says if that gun ends up being used to slay a police officer, then I don't at that point, um, I, I no longer have the self-reporting out the exit plan under the bill, I can't say. Oh, um, you know, I saw that my friend was just involved in a shooting, and police officer, I'm going to rush in and say, oh, by the way, I didn't do any of the paperwork on this person. Now, under your bill, I'm going to 

[2:25:24 PM]

be clean there, right? Because that person, if it's correctable in the sense that I can go back and fill it out after the fact. Right. 
>> And I. 
>> Can fill it out for my friend that I sold to and that that would be something that's therefore correctable. And that's all right. 
>> Would the gentleman yield? 
>> Yeah. Please. 
>> Not doing a background check is an uncorrectable error. So right off the bat the particular example doesn't apply. Well. 
>> If that's the case can we add that specifically. 
>> It is in the bill. It it says it says uncorrectable errors. 
>> The gentleman. 
>> I read it already. 
>> The gentleman I think I think I think the gentleman from California cited this earlier. Page two, line eight I think, I think gentleman from California already cited this. The term uncorrectable violation means any violation, despite best efforts, cannot be corrected by the licensee, including. This is the key part. This is what I think was in the ranking members. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Uh, example violation which I see transfer firearm to a 

[2:26:25 PM]

prohibited person. 
>> That's not a prohibited person in my hypothetical. It's a friend of mine, right, who's not prohibited, but I just don't go through the background check. 
>> But that's a willful violation of a requirement. So. And the term willful on page one, uh, beginning with line 15, the term willful is defined by the meaning in terms section existing law 5336h of title 31. 
>> Would the gentleman yield? 
>> We're very specifically this is a defined term. 
>> Well it also it also narrows. 
>> The hang on the time of the gentleman from who's got the time. I think. 
>> I. 
>> Mr. Raskin. So I will recognize another Democrat. Well, we got to go. 
>> Is there anybody else who can. Says Mr. Johnson. 
>> Mr. Johnson? 
>> Yes. 
>> Yield to the. 
>> Willfulness is limited in this legislation. It limits what can be shown as to be willful behavior. It says that, uh, willfulness only includes 

[2:27:27 PM]

conduct resulting in or resulting from deliberate planning or specific intent. And willfulness also cannot be inferred from previous conduct. So you're making it more difficult to prove willfulness. And you're also adding the fact that a that curable conduct, whatever that is, is presumptively, uh, not willful. 
>> Will the gentleman yield? 
>> I do. 
>> But thank you very kindly, Mr. Johnson, for that clarification. And this goes to the original question that I posed our distinguished friend from California. Um, you were you were retreating to the original definition of willfully under the statute today. But your bill says the term willfully has the meaning given the term in the existing statute, except that the term only includes conduct resulting from or achieved through deliberate planning or specific intent. So I think Mr. Johnson's right. We've altered the definition of willfulness to show that there's got to be 

[2:28:27 PM]

deliberate planning. My hypothetical holds because in my hypothetical, it's not a prohibited person. It's a person who would have been allowed to get it. Well. 
>> The gentleman. 
>> Yeah. 
>> Would that not be a willful act, though, refusing to do the required background check? That's not an oversight. That's not negligence. That's willful. 
>> Exactly. It's willful under the current definition, but not under the new definition. But in any event, our point, it seems to me the point of the amendment is if a firearm is sold in a way that's contrary to the law and it ends up killing a police officer, they should not have the benefit of this new self-reporting, uh, escape hatch. 
>> Uh, if the gentleman from Georgia, I guess, would further yield to me, it's your time. Yeah. 
>> I'll yield to you. 
>> Thank you. Um, if the gentleman would like. We're more than happy to put in the example he gave to make it clear that a a failure to do required acts is not forgivable, 

[2:29:28 PM]

and we're not intending on it. In other words, you don't get a presumption that if you didn't check on your friend that somehow that's not a deliberate act. It is a deliberate act. And and we would consider it willful. So at least as to the example you gave, we would totally be willing to make sure that was there. To the extent that that that, for example, the wrong line on the wrong place has has something that is the type of thing we're looking at. Correcting the three items, though, that we put there that further define a, B, and C there. First of all, I think we can all agree minor, minor, clerical or correctable conduct is already defined in law. So we're we're only saying that that is the minor conduct. It does not include the uncorrectable, which includes selling to an unauthorized person or failing to do things you're supposed to do. The willfulness standard not being inferred from previous conduct, simply says that each each time you see something, it stands on 

[2:30:29 PM]

its own, okay, that somebody not be able to say, well, this has happened two other times on unrelated individuals that there were clerical errors. Uh, the first term, very clearly, uh, through deliberate planning or specific intent. Okay. The example you gave couldn't be more specific intent, failing to do your job in any way, shape or form or neglect of your job is, in fact, and we're happy to have willful negligence, you know, those kinds of terms. If that really would make the gentleman vote for the bill. Our goal is literally to take those things which have historically been correctable under the Clinton administration, under plenty of Truman administration, for that matter, and simply say, we want to have the paperwork done right. If it's done wrong for some reason, we want to correct it. And if there are violations, we still want these flaws to be held accountable. We couldn't share with you more the example 

[2:31:31 PM]

of arrowhead being the kind of organization that it has to be investigated and reinvestigated when that many weapons end up doing things illegally. Okay. And so, um, I know that the gentleman came believing that we're trying to do something nefarious. As the author of the bill, I can assure you and the gentleman from Georgia, all we want to do is make sure that the paperwork nightmare that does exist doesn't cause small businesses to go out of business. 
>> Reclaiming my time. Of course, it's only 15 seconds, but this legislation makes it more difficult for prosecutors to prove willfulness on the part of licensed firearm dealers, and makes it easier for them to maintain their license, and makes it easier for them to obtain a license after their license has been revoked. So it is indeed a licensed gun dealer. Uh, loophole and I. Gentleman's time, encourage my colleagues to vote against it. 

[2:32:33 PM]

>> Okay, chairman. 
>> Gentleman yields back. 
>> Okay. Anybody else? On that? 
>> Gentlelady from Pennsylvania is recognized. 
>> Yeah. Any questions? 
>> Someone someone step up. Nobody. 
>> Mister chairman. All right. Can I ask unanimous consent? I'd ask you. 
>> I would prefer this isn't running. Can can can we draft this at the end? Like, even in a word, doc. 
>> Mr. Chairman, I will be. 
>> The question is let's. 
>> Let's let's. 
>> Get this on the amendment. I believe on this amendment. I think you have something to do with the bill. So if no one's going to talk on the amendment, the question occurs on the amendment offered by the gentlelady from Texas. All those in favor say aye. Those opposed? No, no, no, the chair, the noes have it. Uh, who seeks recognition, miss Scanlon? 

[2:33:34 PM]

>> Uh. 
>> Well, actually, it was Democrat time. So we can go first to the gentleman. Are you getting something drafted? Yeah. Okay, then we will go back to. 
>> Mr. Chairman. I will have an amendment, uh, further amendment available to deal with the ranking member's concern, and we'll add it at an appropriate time. 
>> Great. Gentlelady from Pennsylvania. 
>> Thank you. I'd move to strike. The last word. 
>> Ladies. 
>> Recognize this bill? The firearm act creates more obstacles to gun safety and would effectively grant amnesty to gun dealers who've broken the laws designed to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous individuals. Pennsylvania has been fortunate in that our governor, when he was attorney general, initiated a program to aggregate data to determine where crime guns were coming from. And the data was shocking and very, very clear that a small number of gun dealers are responsible for supplying the majority of the guns used in crimes in Pennsylvania. These 

[2:34:34 PM]

are not just bad apples. These are rotten apples, and they should be subject to more oversight, not less. In Pennsylvania, we found that more than 20,000 crime guns had been purchased from just 11 gun dealers. Understand 1% of the dealers in the state sold 50% of the crime guns used in our region. That's not an accident. It's not something that just happened to happen. These are dealers who display repeated lack of compliance with federal regulations, including transferring firearms to prohibited purchasers, facilitating the straw, purchase of firearms, missing firearms, and a failure to respond to ATF trace requests in a timely manner. We're talking about gun dealers who break the law and endanger American lives. These are reckless businesses that are not responsible enough to sell firearms, and they need strict 

[2:35:34 PM]

oversight. But Republicans on this committee want to just let them off the hook, create more loopholes, hamstringing law enforcement's ability to enforce the rules, and allowing illegal firearms to continue flooding our neighborhood streets as people across our country continue to live with the fear and the grief caused by senseless gun violence, congressional Republicans in their white house allies want to upend all of the progress that we've been trying to make over the past few years to tackle this uniquely American problem. It's especially outrageous when, as we sit here in this committee room, we continue to lose people to this crisis day after day after day, including the horrific shooting at annunciation catholic school in Minnesota just a few days ago, where two children were killed and others were grievously injured while sitting in a back to school 

[2:36:35 PM]

mass. One of my best friends grandchildren were attending that back to school mass when the shooting occurred. These eight and ten year old children saw their classmates murdered and maimed, and they were covered in their classmates blood. The trauma these children experienced will be with them, their families, their church, and their community forever. This is sick. We do not have to live this way. Our children should not be forced to live and die this way. Congress should be doing more, not less, to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. This bill will make it easier for rogue gun dealers to profit off their sales to criminals killing children. I'd ask why Republican members of this committee value the gun lobby more than the lives of our children. Americans are crying out for action, and this Republican congress and this white house are failing them. I 

[2:37:35 PM]

oppose the bill, and I yield back. 
>> Lady yields back. The chair chairs recognize. I'll never forget what, uh, what happened on March 19th, 2024. I think the gentleman from north Carolina talked about the bureaucratic might of the ATF under the Biden administration. March 19th, 2024 ten cars pull up pre-dawn raid Brian Malinowski's house. First thing they do is walk to the doorbell cam and cover the cam with tape. 53 seconds later, Brian Malinowski has been shot. He dies the following day. What did he do wrong? We don't know. They thought he was dealing guns like he shouldn't have been. But what we do know about Mr. Malinowski, what we heard from former U.S. Attorney bud Cummins when he came and testified. What we do know is he was the highest paid official in the Little Rock municipal government ran the bill. And Hillary Clinton airport. We know that the FBI and the ATF excuse me, the ATF surveilled Mr. Malinowski for weeks, knew they could go. It 

[2:38:36 PM]

was a search warrant. They could go confiscate any firearms, search his property. But instead, they're going to wait until he's there. In fact, the week before they were all lined up, the cars at the Walmart were all lined up. We learned this again from the testimony of Mr. Cummings. They were all lined up to go and and figured out Mr. Malinowski was out of town. They waited until he was there, making a situation much more dangerous. And then they go and Brian Malinowski thinks he's getting robbed. He goes to defend himself and his wife, who, by the way, mayor Malinowski said in that first row right there, never forget her amazing lady. That's the bureaucratic might of the ATF. And all this bill says from an ATF who did that is if the if the ffl guy filling out the forms says Joe Smith lives on north Washington street, Little Rock, Arkansas, and he actually lives on south Washington street, you can't take his ffl from him and prosecute him and do whatever. Just if it's a clerical error, that's all it says. But never 

[2:39:38 PM]

forget. Never forget what the Biden ATF did. Brian Malinowski is no longer with us. And his widow came here, heard that testimony. They could have handled that so many different ways. Any law enforcement? Why do a pre-dawn raid, why have ten cars pull up, start banging on the door, cover the doorbell cam? Why do all that for a search warrant when they knew when this guy was going to work, when he wouldn't be there, when he would be there. They could have done it. So many, so much different. This legislation is common sense. That's what it's trying to do. Just common sense. 
>> Will the chair yield? 
>> I'll yield. I'll have already been recognized. I'll yield. Well, actually, I gotta yield to all. Yield to our member first. And I'll come back to you. The gentleman from Virginia. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You're absolutely right. This is. Well, move to strike the last word. What's that? 
>> You're on my time. 
>> Oh, okay. Mr. Chairman, um, I don't know how much time you. You have two minutes. Okay. Uh, I'll be quick. Um, this is 

[2:40:39 PM]

common sense legislation. It is clear from the gentlelady's comments, from the comments on the other side that what thereafter are not, uh, just simply gun, uh, dealers that are, uh, operating against the law or somehow dealing illegal weapons. They want all the guns. They want to take the guns from law abiding American citizens. And when the supreme court decided in heller that individuals have a right to own a gun, they said, well, we've got to get pretty creative. So let's weaponize the bureaucracy and shut down the dealers. If we can't take the guns away from the individuals specifically, then we'll take them. Then we'll shut down the dealers, and that way we'll, uh, make sure that law abiding Americans can't get legal firearms, and we'll do it by weaponizing the bureaucracy, going after these dealers for, uh, small clerical errors, shutting them down one by one 

[2:41:39 PM]

by one. And it's, you know, creative way to get around the heller decision to take guns away from law abiding Americans or prevent them in the first place, from ever being able to buy them by shutting down the dealers. So, you know, it almost worked. Uh, fortunately, the trump administration is making sure that these ffls, these law abiding ffls can operate, law abiding Americans can buy weapons. And I commend the gentleman for his legislation to make sure that what happened under the Biden administration never happens again, I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. 
>> Gentleman yield. 
>> I'll yield. 
>> The chairman talked about the bureaucratic might of the ATF. I want to talk about the bureaucratic might of the $175 billion, is what this committee authorized for, for that agency to morph into the biggest law enforcement agency, uh, on the planet. I think we're talking and at the same time that my 

[2:42:39 PM]

administration is reducing. 
>> The talking about the firearm act, not the big beautiful. 
>> Bill talking about what you just said. 
>> No, I'm talking. 
>> About. The ATF. I'm talking about the HHS. 
>> Talk about the ATF. The time. The time belongs to me, and I'm now out of it. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from California. I think, well, we we're still on the. We got to the other side. We'll go to miss, uh. Miss Mcbath just spoke to you. Have an amendment. 
>> She an amendment? 
>> I haven't spoken, I've been waiting. 
>> All right. Gentlelady is recognized. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, I have an amendment at the desk. 
>> That's what I was asking you. You spoke on the bill, but you're going to get an amendment from Mr. Issa, I think first. Is that correct? 
>> We'll go ahead and. Okay. 
>> Okay. Thank you. Recognized my amendment. 
>> Simply report. 
>> Amendment to the amendment in the. 
>> Nature reporter. 
>> Order without objection will be considered as read point of order being reserved by the gentleman from California. Gentleman from Georgia is recognized to explain the amendment. 

[2:43:40 PM]

>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My amendment simply adds the word lawful to the provision that says willfulness shall not be inferred from previous conduct. This clarifies that when deciding whether to revoke or deny a firearms license for willful violation of the law, the attorney general can consider prior unlawful conduct conduct that broke the law. This is just something simple and it's common sense. When a person gets a parking ticket for parking in the wrong spot, it is reasonable to wonder the first time if they knew that they couldn't park there. But when they do it again and again and again, getting ticket after ticket after ticket, maybe even paying for those tickets at some point we can be pretty confident that they know that they can't park there and they're doing it anyway. Similarly, under current law, when an ATF inspection reveals that the dealer has violated the gun control act, ATF often issues a warning letter that outlines the violations and instructs them to correct them, 

[2:44:40 PM]

and warns the dealer that they might lose their license if they don't correct the violations and start following the law. If ATF learns of another violation, there could be another warning letter or a warning conference in which the dealer is required to meet with the ATF to discuss the violations and how to fix them. If a dealer continues to violate the same laws. After warning letters and conferences based on their previous conduct, we can be pretty sure that they know that they're violating those laws. In fact, current ATF guidance says that ATF can establish willfulness in part by a dealer's repeat violations, with documentation that ATF personnel discuss the violations with the dealer. This includes warning letters and warning conferences as written. This bill could be read to require ATF to turn a 

[2:45:42 PM]

blind eye to repeated violations of the law, even after ATF has issued multiple warning letters or conducted a warning conference. Since these could be considered previous conduct. My amendment simply just fixes this by making clear that ATF can't infer willfulness from previous lawful conduct. When a dealer follows the law, as the vast majority of our dealers do follow the law, they can rest assured that they have nothing to worry about. We want them to be able to lawfully sell their guns, and in many cases, ATF will work with them to correct violations and bring them into compliance. But when a dealer is warned repeatedly and even meets with ATF, then continues to still break the law, ATF should be able to consider that previous unlawful conduct in 

[2:46:43 PM]

deciding whether or not to revoke that license. Without this amendment, dealers could be allowed to break the law over and over again, putting the safety of our communities at risk without any accountability. And I'd like to say during the recess, I spent a great deal of time in Georgia at the ATF and also Brunswick at fletc. I spent two full days just really getting to understand the work that they do, and the complications and the problems that have been arising due to the increase in gun violence. And with the ATF said that they really depended on us. Congress is really helping to make their jobs easier, and that the increasing rates of rye, uh, crime that they feel oftentimes, too, that they're outgunned or outmanned, this simply, this small amendment simply helps them to do that very thing. It's not a big ask. So if we really care 

[2:47:43 PM]

about keeping our community safer, if we really care about helping, you know, law enforcement specifically because they have such a difficult job to do, this is just a simple amendment that builds more protection against, um, you know, against violations that are made by our gun. 
>> Would the gentlelady yield? 
>> Yes, I do. 
>> Uh, if I'm prepared to accept your amendment, will you vote for the bill? 
>> I have to discuss it with my staff. 
>> But you'll consider it. 
>> I will consider it. 
>> Then, uh, if you'll yield back, I'll. 
>> And I yield. 
>> Chairman. 
>> Gentleman yields back. 
>> Gentleman. Yields back. Gentleman of California. 
>> Chairman. 
>> I withdraw my reserve. Uh, and, uh, I'm prepared to accept this, uh, sensible amendment. Uh, I don't believe it particularly changes the intent. I believe it's well intended. It is clear that we do not want to have prohibitive or unlawful conduct. Uh, one could have put the word unlawful as easily as lawful in there, and so I'm 

[2:48:44 PM]

prepared to accept it and hope that will cause the gentlelady to vote for the bill. 
>> The, uh, the question is on the amendment offered by the gentlelady from Georgia. All those in favor say aye. Aye. Those opposed? No. The chair, the ayes have it. And that wonderful bipartisan spirit. We will now go to the gentleman from California who I think has an amendment as well. 
>> Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. 
>> Report amendment to the amendment in the nature of a substitute. 
>> Objection amendment be considered as read. The gentleman from California is recognized. Explain the amendment. 
>> Chairman, again, in the spirit of wanting to make this a a truly bipartisan bill, one that limits only to clerical mistakes, uh, and nothing more. On page two, line 11, we're inserting or failed to perform a required background check after, uh, and that goes after prohibited person to specifically make an example of something we believe was covered. But we absolutely want to make sure there's no doubt is covered. So the bill would now include required background 

[2:49:44 PM]

check. 
>> Gentleman. Gentleman yields back. Uh, seeks recognition. The question. 
>> Mr. Chairman. 
>> Let's go to Mr. Raskin and then Mr. Not. 
>> Thank you Mr. Is this amendment in response to the colloquy that we had? Yes it is and I appreciate, uh, your doing that very much. And I took it it was not your intention to, uh, exclude the failure to perform a required background check. Um, and so I will strongly support this amendment. I just want to, um, inquire, um, about something else, which, again, might just be completely accidental in terms of the drafting of this. But right now, um, there's a there's a provision, a safe harbor provision. You can look at it that way. We've been calling it amnesty provision. It doesn't make any difference. But a 30 day waiting period after the ATF tells you that there's giving, that it's 

[2:50:45 PM]

giving you actual notice of a violation, then you have 30 days within which you can essentially cure your violation. 
>> A curable violation. 
>> Yeah, yeah, a curable violation. Okay. But what it doesn't say is that a willful violation is not curable, so that it doesn't say that a willful violation is an uncorrectable violation. And so you start off by saying, of course, if somebody is deliberately trying to violate the law, get around the terms of the law, deal into the criminal underworld, whatever, they shouldn't be covered. But I think it's quite by accident. I think it's adventitious here, but the way it's written, it says the ATF must honor that 30 day waiting period. Even if we're talking about a willful, deliberate violation of the law. And I just wonder if you would be amenable to a similar amendment correcting that. 
>> Absolutely. The, uh, if the 

[2:51:45 PM]

ATF believes they have a strong case for a willful violation or they have a case for willful violation, there'd be no reason not to pursue, uh, that immediately. So we can work together on the language and get that either now or before it goes to the Flo, no question at all. That's a sensible thing to make sure we have. 
>> A question. Yeah. 
>> Oh, sorry. 
>> Just one other similar question. Uh, if I got a second, which is that, um. Let's see, the attorney general's prohibited from bringing enforcement action for a self-reported violation if it's correctable, whether or not it's ever actually corrected. And so my question is, I was reading it was, is it enough that the violation is one that's theoretically correctable or that it actually is corrected? And again, 
>> I right. 
>> And I assumed that it meant it's correctable and the dealer actually does correct it. Uh, I would absolutely. 
>> Agree with the gentleman. We can make sure that's part of our technical correction package so that it that it requires that they do do 

[2:52:47 PM]

correct it, uh, in a timely fashion. And that and to be honest, Jamie, that's the reason for this 30 days is we if they don't correct it within 30 days, then the attorney general's abeyance is gone on a correctable. So absolutely we we expect that you get notice and you've got 30 days. And if you don't do it then it becomes a violation that is now executable as it was under the old rule. 
>> Gentleman. Gentleman yields back. Um, question occurs on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California. 
>> Chairman I would ask unanimous consent that that be correct. 
>> That way if you want unanimous consent to accept the amendment. Uh, here. No objection. The amendment is now part of the legislation. The question occurs on the amendment in the nature of a substitute with, as amended. Uh. 
>> Mr. Chairman, I just had one other amendment again, following, you know, Mr. Issa's, um, I think clarification of 

[2:53:48 PM]

his intent. Um, what we did there was we said, um, that if there was, uh, a deliberate, uh, violation, um, that that's something that should not be included. There were three other things also that I think may have been accidentally excluded. One was refusing to allow an ATF investigator to conduct an inspection, two is falsifying records and three failing to respond to a trace record. Again, those are three things which I don't think you meant to rewrite here. I mean, in other words, it's parallel to what we just did. 
>> And we'll. 
>> Take a picture and circulate. 
>> To staff. Yeah. 
>> And so I just want to introduce an amendment which also makes clear that they also, um, are bracketed in uncorrectable. 
>> Uh, you know, we would we would work with the gentleman 

[2:54:49 PM]

because we don't consider what you've just described, any of it minor clerical. So we're happy to make that clear in the, in the final bill as we come to the floor. 
>> Okay. Well, then I look forward to working with you further on that. Absolutely. 
>> I to be clear, you don't have an amendment at the desk. 
>> No, no, we can we can do these in technical corrections. I think they're well agreed to. 
>> Question occurs on the adoption of the amended amendment in the nature of a substitute. This will be followed immediately by a vote on reporting the bill. All those in favor say aye. Aye. Those opposed? No. The opinion of the chair. The ayes have it. And the amendment in the nature of a substitute is adopted. The question is in favor of reporting the bill as amended. All those in favor say aye. I opposed. No, no. The ayes have it. And the bill is ordered to be reported favorably to the house. Members will have two days to submit views. The. 
>> We have a recorded vote. 
>> Of the bill.

[2:58:06 PM]

Mr. Chairman, there are 15 ayes and eight nos. 
>> The, uh, amended amendment substitute is adopted. Without objection. The bill will be favorably reported. Yeah, it's reported without objection. The bill will be reported as a single amendment. The nature of a substitute incorporating all adopted amendments. And the staff is authorized to make technical and conforming changes. 
>> All right. Sit here for a minute. Wesley hunt walks here. He'll be here in a minute. 
>> As long as there's not. As long as there's not a recorded vote. 

[3:01:18 PM]

We have nine technical correction bills to consider consistent with the committee's practice. Without objection, the committee will consider these nine bills in unblank hearing. None. Pursuant to notice, I call up H.R. 4065, H.R. 4099, H.R. 4023, H.R. 4584, H.R. 5085, H.R. 4082, H.R. 5001 74, H.R. 5210, and H.R. 5204. The clerk will report the bills H.R. Without objection, the bills be considered as read and open for amendment at any point. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from California. I actually cannot recognize himself. These nine bills before us today were submitted to the committee by the office of law revision counsel. The olc is a small office in the house of representatives that is responsible for preparing and publishing the united States code. As congress passes laws, the code needs to be updated to incorporate those new laws and to ensure that references are correct. Providing the maintenance of the code is the responsibility of judiciary committee, and the lrc assist us in doing that. The bills before us today make technical editorial corrections 

[3:02:19 PM]

to update the code and incorporate laws passed by congress. These bills do not change the meaning of any law on the books today. Our committee has historically dealt with these bills in a bipartisan manner, and we will continue to do that. This congress, we traditionally divide these bills equally between the majority and the minority. Sometimes, like today, we have an odd number of bills. Last congress, our Democrat colleagues agreed to alternate which party receives the extra bill in this situation? We had an extra bill last congress, and pursuant to that agreement, the Democrats have the extra bill today. Um, I want to thank our Democrat colleagues, our staff and their staff for working with us to advance an uneven number of bills so that the Americans can have an up to date and accurate code. And I want to thank Mr. Schmidt. Mr. Harris. Mr. Mr. Bob good. Mr. Raskin. Mr. Goldman, Mrs. Lagerlof, miss. Crockett and Mr. Moskowitz for sponsoring these bills. I urge all members to support the bills. The chair now recognizes the ranking member. 
>> Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. It's a bipartisan set of non-controversial bills that will keep the us code up to date and accessible to all of our citizens. So I'm very 

[3:03:19 PM]

pleased to support them. I thank the chairman for his leadership in putting it all together. Currently consisting of 54 different titles, the us code is a compilation of the vast array of federal laws that we've got organized and into coherent subject areas. As new laws are passed, they get integrated into the code, which is a painstaking process undertaken by the very dedicated professionals in the office of law revision counsel, as part of the office's efforts to maintain the code. They work to make it more efficient and easier to navigate. This includes correcting technical errors, removing ambiguities, updating statutory cross-references, and repealing obsolete provisions the bills were considering today are a result of this exhaustive process. It's important to note these bills make no change to the meaning or effect of any existing laws that are purely technical in nature, and will help ensure the code is authoritative, accurate and accessible. I want to thank the chairman for continuing this committee's long tradition of considering these bills in a bipartisan manner, and I want to thank the sponsors of each 

[3:04:20 PM]

bill for bringing them forward. I urge everybody to support the legislation and yield back to you, Mr. Chairman. 
>> Chairman. 
>> Objection. All of the statements will be included in the record. There is an ans for one of the bills today. Um. After Mr. Harris introduced H.R. 4499, the olc notified us that they needed to make a couple of corrections. So the chair now recognizes the gentleman from California to offer that amendment. 
>> Chairman, I have an amendment, the desk. 
>> Report amendment in the nature of objection. 
>> The amendment be considered as red will be considered as base text for purposes of the amendment. The chair recognizes the gentleman from California to explain the amendment. 
>> Chairman, the explanation you gave is more than sufficient. Uh, they found a further need for a revision after it was delivered to us, delivered it to us, and we are now implementing it. And I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. The question is on the adoption of the amendment in the nature of a substitute, H.R. 4099. This will be followed by a vote on reporting the bills. All those in favor say aye. Those opposed? No. The chair the ayes have it. And the amendment in nature of substitute is adopted. The 

[3:05:20 PM]

question is unfavorably reporting the bills. In the case of H.R. 4099, as amended. All those in favor say aye. Aye. Those opposed? No. The ayes have it, and the bills are ordered to be reported favorably to the house. Members will have two days to submit views. Without objection, H.R. 4099 will be reported as a single amendment. The nature of a substitute, incorporating all adopted amendments and staff, is authorized to make technical and conforming changes to the bills. We will now go back to Mr. Hunt's legislation. 
>> I'm sorry. 
>> Uh, the chair recognizes the gentleman from. Texas. Oh. Pursuant to notice, I call up first, H.R. 3592, the protect the lng act of 2025. Purpose of markup. In the move that the committee reported favorably to the house, the clerk will report the bill. 
>> H.R. 35. 
>> Objection. The bill be considered as read and open for amendment at any point. Now. The chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hunt, for an opening statement. 
>> Mr. Chairman. 
>> As energy congresswoman of the world from Houston, Texas, I have traveled the entire country. 

[3:06:20 PM]

>> Visiting energy. 
>> Assets all across America. 
>> From the permian basin in the marcellus shale, from the gulf of America to the beautiful state of Iowa. Throughout my travels, I've heard time and time again about the incredible opportunities America's energy industry provides. I don't just mean air conditioning. During the summer months in the hot Houston heat, the oil, gas, energy, the oil and gas and energy industry and our great nation provides more than just energy provides opportunity. Opportunity for those who deserve a second chance at life. Opportunity for those who couldn't afford a college degree. Opportunities for communities that have been left behind by Washington, D.C. The energy industry in America provides millions of Americans with employment who contribute to our great nation. However, my time in congress, I've come to realize that the climate cartel and radical environmental groups will sue any and all energy projects just so they could stifle the opportunities that I just mentioned. That's why my legislation to protect lng act is so important. The protect lng act aims to limit frivolous 

[3:07:22 PM]

litigation that attempts to stop America from producing the cleanest, most abundant and safest energy on planet Earth. My home state of Texas is the leading exporter of us lng, and the radical left has targeted it for extinction. Never. And not on my watch. This legislation does three things. It clarifies lawsuits that will be heard by federal judges where lng facilities are located. It prevents activist groups from filing lawsuits more than 90 days after the project is permitted, and it mandates the federal courts grant expedited decisions for lng facility lawsuits. The United States lng industry has the power to lift the world out of poverty, while providing tens of thousands of jobs to my fellow Americans and also my home state of Texas. U.S. Lng happens to be the fastest and cleanest lng found anywhere in the world. The lng act is necessary to ensure that companies no longer face frivolous lawsuits that stifle and prohibit newly permitted 

[3:08:23 PM]

projects. I'd like to thank chairman Jordan and and congressman Issa for joining me in this very important effort. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I yield back the remainder of my time, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Thank you. 
>> Recognizes the ranking member, Mr. Raskin, for an opening statement. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, I oppose the legislation which exempts one kind of fuel, liquefied natural gas lng, from key laws that govern the industry to protect the public health and safety, and to ensure that the American people have a say in matters that affect their own properties and community. Lng is a fuel that is dirtier and more carbon intensive than coal, and is most often derived from fracking. Texas Republicans, who are the main supporters of the bill, are so eager to protect the fossil fuel industry, they now want to exempt the approval of permits for lng terminals and lng export authorizations from the general laws that congress has passed, and from all judicial review. Even if a court finds that the agency broke the law 

[3:09:24 PM]

to issue a new lng permit, this bill blocks the court from vacating the permit and requires that the matter be remanded to the very agency that broke the law in the first place. Approvals of new fracking fuel export sites are subject to a range of laws, including the administrative procedure act, the national environmental policy act, Nepa and the natural gas act. Collectively, they require that the environmental and health consequences of new or modified sites must be taken into consideration to ensure that the export sites do not threaten the people's health or endanger community safety, and also provide the American people with the right to comment on and challenge site approvals in court. Under these laws, everyone who is affected by a new site can obtain justice if they're harmed. In our courts have the right to review and, if necessary, require corrections before permits are issued and projects begin. This bill, the protect 

[3:10:25 PM]

lng act, would silence the public and limit our courts stifling proper participation in the process. It would undermine the critical safety bills congress passed that protect our health, our environment, our communities. It would funnel all appeals regarding the export of lng fuel or the creation, expansion or operation of lng fracking facility through the jurisdiction where a facility is or would be located. As a practical matter, this would direct most cases through the extremely conservative mega judge packed fifth circuit. But even those judges won't have the ability to reverse relevant fuel export site decisions. Instead, the manner the matter would have to be remanded to the agency. In other words, the bill makes it harder to hold big fossil fuel companies to account when their projects threaten to pollute groundwater, destroys wetlands, degrade air quality, emit chemicals that cause cancer, harms wildlife, or endangers gulf coast

fisheries. Republicans want to exempt this one type of fuel from the environmental laws congress has passed, has passed to protect against precisely these kinds of harms. Why is lng so special? We lead the world in the export of this fracking fuel, and there's no danger of us losing our edge. This fuel is not cleaner, safer, or more special in any way that should merit its extremely special and prized status and treatment under this bill. Earlier this year, my Republican colleagues passed the separation of powers restoration act, a bill to ensure judges interpret the law without any deference to agency interpretations. This generally has been the majority's approach, arguing often and always that we cannot trust the expert civil servants in our federal agencies that instead we should leave key matters of legal interpretation to judges people in the judicial branch. But today, the majority wants to advance a bill that strips federal judges of their power over agency decisions about lng 

[3:12:28 PM]

permits and instead vested all with the agency, effectively giving one agency discretion. That was just overturned by the supreme court in the lower, bright decision that my colleagues and I have praised, there is no reason to exempt this one dirty, carbon intensive fuel from our laws and from our courts and from ordinary process. My colleagues who support this legislation want to exempt lng, a fuel derived from fracking, from our laws and our courts, and they are making it clear that they privilege the success of this one industry over the health of the people in your community. Under current law, communities where fracking export facilities are located have a legal right to challenge polluters in court. But Republicans seem to want to close the courtroom door to these challenges and any others. As one Louisiana resident noted, I can't go in my backyard and plant a garden because the soil is so polluted. Today, Republicans want to make sure those harms are unheard and 

[3:13:28 PM]

unmitigated, and an agency can approve the sites they want without any oversight or participation or pushback from the public. Vote for this bill is a vote for the fossil fuel companies and billionaires who will benefit from this striking exemption. This bill is an abdication of our general obligation to protect our constituents across the country. Under the bill, our response to a finding of serious environmental flaws is to leave the permit in force and not freeze a given project. This will undermine our environmental laws, weaken public health protections, and cede power to the industry itself. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this effort to exempt lng from our laws, from the oversight of the courts and from the public, and we also would like to introduce Mr. Nadler's opening, if that's okay. Mr. Chairman, I yield back to. 
>> You. 
>> Unanimous consent to enter representative Nadler's statement on the record. Without objection, the ranking member yields back. Without objection. All of their opening statements will be included in the record. The chair now 

[3:14:29 PM]

recognizes the gentleman from Texas to offer an amendment. The nature of a substitute. 
>> Mr. Chairman, an amendment at the desk. 
>> Report the amendment. 
>> Amendment. In the nature. 
>> Objection. Amendment, the nature of substitute will be considered as read and shall be considered. Base tax will be base tax for the purposes of amendment. The chair now recognize the gentleman from Texas to explain the amendment. 
>> Mr. Chairman, this amendment removes quote of 2025 from the title of the bill. This change is not intended in any way to alter the important part of this bill. I urge my support for my colleagues and please accept my amendment. I yield back the rest of my time. 
>> Gentleman yields back. Anyone, anyone wish to speak? Question. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized. 
>> Have an amendment. 
>> The gentleman has an amendment at the desk. Clerk will report. 
>> Amendment to the amendment in. 
>> The nature will be considered as read. Gentleman is recognized from Arizona to explain his amendment. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, I'll explain my amendment by saying thank goodness for the underlying bill. Thank goodness for that. You know what? Natural gas has been proven to 

[3:15:29 PM]

be cleaner. It's cheaper and it will benefit consumers all over this country, regardless of their income or demographic. Thank god for that. Thank you. So my amendment, uh, basically says all the people that are going to come file the lawsuits because they're going to come file the lawsuits, you know, they are it simply prohibits plaintiffs from being awarded attorney's fees under the proceedings covered by the bill. This amendment dissuades activist plaintiffs from filing frivolous suits or petitions to stop the operation of already approved facilities, already approved facilities. That's where they want to come in. They want to come in, they've already been approved, and they're going to sue. That's that's what happens here. And they hope to settle. And so we simply say on, you know, you don't I urge adoption of the amendment and I yield back. 
>> The gentleman yields back. 
>> Um. 
>> Question. 

[3:16:30 PM]

>> Sir. 
>> I was going to go amendment unless you want to. 
>> Yeah. I was just going to say one thing about the amendment. 
>> That was recognized. 
>> We oppose it strongly. I mean, if you want to, uh, overturn the administrative procedure act, the Nepa, the national environmental policy act, the natural gas act, fine, go ahead and do it. But all of those are laws that have been passed by congress, that have been working to make sure that the people can be heard. So our communities are not polluted by people who take the money and run. So we've got the opportunity to sue if they're violating the law. Now, you want to strip away, uh, their ability to find lawyers by saying that lawyers can't get paid? I mean, it's ridiculous. So, uh, we strongly oppose that. And, uh, you know, I take it there are people who would like to reverse all of our environmental laws. Then they should just go ahead and do it. But we should certainly not do it by the back door simply by saying we're not going to allow anybody to find a lawyer. So we oppose it strongly. 
>> Question occurs, question occurs. Gentlelady from California is recognized to 

[3:17:31 PM]

speak on the amendment. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Uh, I you know, I don't support this amendment at all, and I don't support the underlying bill. No, thank god for the underlying bill. This I feel like this is like national make this country less healthy and safe day based on these bills that we've been considering in committee today, we're basically saying it's okay to have more and more bad guns on the streets, um, making our communities less safe and making law enforcement less safe, making them work harder with less money. That's what the last bill was about. And now this bill. This is not about healthy, thriving communities. Communities are already struggling because we cut, you know, medicare, and we're going to be closing down hospitals and community clinics. And now you're saying that communities who are struggling because they might be in the proximity of oil fields or, you 

[3:18:34 PM]

know, um, we'll have less opportunity to fight for their own safety and health. You know, my district has the Inglewood oil fields. It is the largest urban oil field in the country. And my district has something called cancer alley, where a disproportionate number of constituents, two legged and four legged, okay, pets and people dying from cancer at alarming rates. And we have have had studies up the wazoo because it's not just crazy activists complaining about oil, it's about people dying from cancer. And earlier this year, you all cut funding for cancer research so folks can be dying all kinds of ways because they continue to get shot. And you don't want ATF to regulate, make sure that bad guns aren't off the street. They're going to continue to go to hospitals 

[3:19:35 PM]

because they have to go to emergency rooms and urgent care because they don't have health care. And now you're saying, well, get cancer, stop the research, and just make it more difficult for you to sue and get what's right for yours, and maybe stop bad actors from continuing to pollute communities. How about that? I can't tell you how many town halls I have had in my district, where grandparents have talked about having to put metal stents in their grandchildren's bodies because they're having a hard time breathing, or because they got asthma at a young age, and cancer. So I know there's so much politics and performance and propaganda all up in these committees, but at some point we just have to face real facts. And it's like, I 

[3:20:38 PM]

cannot believe we are talking about a bill that's saying, you know, if you want to sue because people are putting toxins in your community, we're going to make it more difficult for you to do that. And, you know, we actually do live in a country where sometimes the only way you can get something is to sue, to make people pay so that maybe they'll think again before they do something bad. I mean, that's what even all this stuff is about. Epstein. Like, just like fight and make people hold people accountable so people will think twice before they do something bad. So, you know, yeah, we're not making communities healthy. We're not helping them get more jobs. We're tying people's hands who already feel like the government is out to get them. I mean, and this committee passes so many bills that says we want the government to do less. Hey, people, you're on your own. It's like we're telling the American people, 

[3:21:38 PM]

well, I'm not, but it's like people in this committee are telling the American people, screw you. And it's the ones that need our help and protection and due process the most. It's the haves and the have nots. And this is about just giving so much more to the powerful. So I just have to oppose this on behalf of all the constituents in my district in south la and Culver city who've been fighting against the Inglewood oil fields, who are like, we deserve the right to sue, to try to make sure that our community is safer and healthier. I would ask that you vote no on this and on the underlying bill. And with that, I yield my time.

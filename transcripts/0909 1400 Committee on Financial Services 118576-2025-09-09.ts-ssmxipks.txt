an objection. The chair is authorized to declare a recess of the committee at any time. This hearing is titled promoting the health of the banking sector, reforming resolution and broadening funding access for long term resilience. Without objection, all members will have five legislative days within which to submit extraneous materials to the chair for inclusion in the record. I now recognize myself for five minutes for an opening statement. Thank you to our witnesses for being here and for offering their expertise on this important discussion. Today we will explore a series of topics that focus on promoting a healthy banking industry for institutions of all sizes. We will examine ways to promote competition in the fdic's resolution process for failed banks, and explore how decisions made in response to the 2023 bank failures, such as the invocation of the systemic risk exception to guarantee all uninsured deposits, created unnecessary uncertainty at a time when clear guidance was 

[2:20:55 PM]

especially necessary. We will also look into potential reforms to the fdic's bidding process for failed banking assets and liabilities, with the goal of ensuring that community banks have a fair opportunity to acquire all or part of a failing institution. Community banks and regional banks, particularly when such outcomes best serve the interests of local communities. More broadly, the least cost test should not operate as a rigid constraint that effectively limits participation in the resolution process to only the largest institutions. We want all institutions of all sizes to be able to to bid on these failed, failed banks. We will also discuss how access to diverse funding sources allows banks to remain competitive and continue to serve their communities. The current misalignment in the regulatory treatment of brokered reciprocal and custodial deposits have placed handcuffs on small, well, well managed financial institutions 

[2:21:56 PM]

ability to sustainably fund themselves and reform is necessary. I look forward to hearing from the witnesses about how legislation attached to this hearing would remove unnecessary barriers to bank funding, ensuring banks have access to diverse and stable sources of deposits that allow them to continue the lending activities that make our economy thrive. Restrictions on various deposit types, such as brokered, reciprocal and custodial should be based on actual risks to stability, not the whims of banking regulators. Finally, we will highlight the imperative that congress rightsize the capital framework for small and mid-size banks in the dodd-frank world. Our capital regime has moved too far away from a tailored system, negatively impacting small and mid-size banks and hindering their ability to survive and compete against larger institutions. We must reverse course on this, as a diverse banking system is at the heart of a resilient and competitive 

[2:22:57 PM]

banking sector on a bipartisan basis. Congress directed regulators in 2018 to tailor regulations based on an institution's size, risk profile and complexity. However, under the Biden administration, regulators failed to fulfill this statutory mandate, and we look forward to new leadership to ensure that a regulatory scheme designed for the biggest banks does not become the rules for all banks. Luckily, the regulators have the tools to further tailor regulations and reduce red tape, hampering the growth of small and mid-size banking institutions. This committee will continue to urge the federal banking agencies to use the authorities they currently possess to provide much needed relief for banks, while protecting financial stability and safety and soundness. Community and regional banks have the unique ability to put necessary cash in the pockets of local businesses. And today's discussion will highlight the need for reform to guarantee long term resilience and access to capital. The overly 

[2:23:57 PM]

burdensome regulations imposed by the dodd-frank act and subsequent rulemakings from the federal banking agencies have crippled community banks and mid-size banks and regional banks through heightened capital and liquidity standards, narrower sources of funding, and a miscalibrated bank merger review process. I look forward to hearing from our expert witnesses on these important topics and what we can do in congress to reverse the negative impact of burdensome regulations that I yield back. And I now recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee, doctor foster, for four minutes for an opening statement. 
>> Thank you, chairman Barr. And to our witnesses today, the subcommittee will examine topics that underpin the stability of the us financial system. We will understand the avenues banks use to fund their operations, whether stress and promote economic growth in our communities. Alongside this hearing, we will consider changes to the resolution process to ensure that failing financial institutions wind down their operations in a way that minimizes disruption for customers and the broader financial system, while preserving competition. I 

[2:24:58 PM]

believe that these are timely and important topics, as this body and the administration look to make changes in the regulatory and supervisory framework governing the American banking system. Throughout this process, we should promote updates that reflect the current state of the banking system, respond to changing technology and the composition of the banking system, and keep in mind the unique needs of small community banks and credit unions. Technological innovation, while often beneficial, carries some risk. In 2023, we saw mobile banking technology and social media supercharged bank runs on silicon valley bank, leading depositors to pull out nearly $40 billion in deposits from the bank in under 48 hours. The failure of silvergate and silicon valley bank triggered runs on several other banks, ultimately forcing regulators to invoke emergency authorities to stem contagion. So I fear that this type situation will become more common as technology reduces friction in banking and increases the speed of information across the 

[2:25:59 PM]

country. That said, the regional bank failures in 2023 started an important conversation about how to prevent rapid and and large scale bank failures from rippling across the economy. JP Morgan's acquisition of first Republican first republic bank raised questions about the appropriateness of fdic's least cost resolution, and whether there may be alternative approaches worth considering. I'd also like to thank chair, Barr and hill for noticing congressman lynch's bill the failing bank acquisition fairness act, which would ensure that small institutions have an opportunity to bid on failing banks, assuming they can do so in a manner that's cost effective for the deposit insurance fund. Members of our committee have also sought ways to manage the risks associated with high levels of uninsured deposits, which were a contributing factor to the failure of svb deposit insurance reform and expanded access to reciprocal deposits and other changes to the regulatory framework are among the proposals being considered in this hearing today. And so, 

[2:26:59 PM]

as our committee considers these issues, we must continue supporting the financial institutions in all of our communities. This includes more than 30 years of congressional support for community development, financial institutions and minority depository institutions that serve low income and historically underserved communities. Since its creation, the cdphe has fund has supported more than 19 million loans totaling more than $300 billion, leveraging private capital to spur investments in infrastructure, child care center, homeownership, and entrepreneurship across all 50 states. Um, well, I really appreciate the timing and subject of this hearing and look forward to hearing from the witnesses. 
>> Uh, the gentleman yields back, and today we we welcome the testimony of Mr. Dory Wylie, president and CEO of commerce street holdings, Dallas. Uh, Mr. James Bracey, partner at 

[2:28:01 PM]

squire Patton boggs. Mr. Hugh kearney, executive vice president of financial institutions policy and regulatory affairs at the American bankers association. Doctor Norbert Michel, vice president and director of the cato institute's center for monetary and financial alternatives. And Mr. Robert James, president and CEO of carver financial corporation, here on behalf of the national bankers association, we thank each of you for taking time to be here. Uh, each of you will be recognized for five minutes to give an oral presentation of your testimony. Without objection, your written statements will be made part of the record. Mr. Wylie, you are now recognized for five minutes for your oral remarks. 
>> Thank you. Chairman. Chairman. Barr, ranking member, foster, members of the subcommittee. Thank you. 
>> For having me here today. And hopefully, uh, I can provide some small help in any way I can. Glad to be here. I'm dory Wylie, president and CEO of commerce street holdings, a Dallas based investment bank. Uh, that does m&a advisory and 

[2:29:02 PM]

and investing in banks. For almost 40 years, I've started banks raise capital for banks, invested billions of dollars, uh, raised billions of dollars for community banks and advise through crises. These crises include the snl crisis of the 80s, where we lost over 1000 banks, the Texas banking crash where we lost over 200 bank failures. We've got a roadmap of the scars on our back from from those time periods. The 2008 great recession with over 500 failures, and of course, the 2023 failures that we're all familiar with. Of those four banks, uh, experience shows that we must make banking investable again. I think we forget that sometimes. Now, first of all, I'd like to say, you know, we have the best banking system in the world, in world history. And what we're doing is just fine tuning what we have here. But we want to ensure fair investing, fair funding rules and let these banks compete. We have to remember that they're not 

[2:30:03 PM]

utilities. We want them to compete. We're partnering with them on the government side, the 2023 failures exposed some familiar problems low equity capital, poor risk management and shaky confidence. Now, however, most banks came through with shining colors. Most of them did very good job of asset liability management, credit underwriting and holding high capital standards. These exceptions shouldn't have happened, but they did. We saw similar runs in brokered deposits in 2008 and the 1980s and the vast, uh, the biggest issue bank holding companies like, uh, silicon valley banks had dangerously low capital, around 5.5%. These holding companies have to be a source of strength when they don't have enough capital, they can't. There's no room or margin for error. They can't support their banks. Just like during the great recession when things went wrong. Now dodd-frank rules. Amazingly, banks have adapted quite a bit, but they 

[2:31:04 PM]

cost banks $60 billion a year, having crossed community bank profits, pushing opportunities outside the system, increasing, not necessarily reducing systemic danger and risk. And this has turned away investors and talent, making banking less attractive. Congress should cut these regulatory burdens to bring investment capital back to banks. Let me close by emphasizing an appeal to and the critical role of virtue in our financial system. George Washington wisely noted, few men have the virtue to withstand the highest bidder. Yet, over my decades in banking, I've witnessed the vast majority of bankers embody this virtue, running their institutions with integrity, prioritizing customers, and upholding trust. This is especially vital in the united States, the only nation with a robust community banking system in the world. These banks are the backbone of our economy, fueling job creation and nurturing small businesses that drive innovation and growth. 

[2:32:06 PM]

Our community bankers, together with regulators and by extension, congress, honor this principle, acting as stewards of public trust. Ensuring capital serves main street, not just Wall Street. Let us continue to support and strengthen this virtuous foundation, ensuring our community banks, our banking system in general and our whole economy thrive for generations to come. Thank you. 
>> Mr. Bracey. You're now recognized for five minutes. 
>> Thank you. Chairman, ranking member, foster and members of the subcommittee for the opportunity to testify here with you today. My name is Jim borisy. I lead the financial services practice at squire Patton boggs, which is a global law firm. Uh, I'm here today in my personal capacity, not on behalf of my firm or any client of our firm. And I'm here in hopes to share with you practical insight that I've obtained for spending more than 30 years laser focused on 

[2:33:08 PM]

advising main street banks and also having on two occasions during that time period spent multiple years embedded in house as the deputy general counsel of a what started as a small regional bank that, after a string of a long string of large acquisitions, ultimately became, uh, a very safe and well regarded super regional bank that competes with the largest banks in the country. Turning to the state of our us banking system, for a long time, our banking system has been both the envy of the world and the engine for economic growth in the United States. But the laws and regulatory framework that govern it are antiquated. Now, uh, they need updating to function effectively in a fast moving digital area era. Um, we need to be able to move quickly, because sometimes, as we saw in 

[2:34:08 PM]

the spring of 23, the inability to move with dexterity itself can be dangerous. So we're hopeful that this committee will continue to be, uh, assertive in adopting change, like like it did with the genius act, and we're greatly appreciative of that. I'd like to use the auto industry as a quick illustration for what we have in mind. Um, the auto industry, of course, is regulated, like the financial services industry. But in the last few decades, you've seen widespread adoption of innovative, um, innovative tools like airbags, automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assistance, blind spot monitoring and many others. I don't think there's any doubt that these tools improve safety and the efficient operation of our transportation system, but it's much harder to do that in bank land than it is in other regulated industries because of the multi-layered, overlapping regulatory regime and structure we have, and because of the 

[2:35:11 PM]

trepidation that our regulatory regime has historically shown to to innovation. What we're asking congress to do here is to build the financial equivalent of an interstate highway system that enables our banks of various types, just like various types of vehicles on the road, to move with efficient capability and the speed to safely deliver financial products to those throughout the United States. So we have a host of recommendations in our written testimony. I won't repeat them all here, but just to highlight some for you. First, with respect to the bank resolution process, it's way too rigid and it's not competitive for anyone other than the biggest banks in the country. It needs to be modified to enable smaller players to participate effectively in auctions. It needs to enable, uh, those banks to show up and have their capital capacity evaluated. For example, if they show up with private capital sources or the ability to bring additional 

[2:36:13 PM]

capital to the table to effect transactions. And there are techniques like virtual data rooms that could be maintained, uh, on a real time basis to enable bidders to act. Um, deposit insurance, of course, is part and parcel of any discussion on improving resolutions, and I won't rehash that here, other than to note that our deposit insurance systems need some updating, and I have in my written testimony, and I'm happy to address some, uh, some ideas that are not expensive, uh, for the system and that could be utilized. Um, third, I think the 2023 bank failures identify issues with liquidity in two respects. One, access to reliable emergency liquidity for banks that are in difficulty. And we can proactively combat the stigma at the federal reserve's discount window and improve the operational readiness of each of the fed in the federal home 

[2:37:13 PM]

loan banks so that they can act, uh, to process large volumes of requests and prioritize among them, and then finally to harmonize some of the collateral practices across all the regional banks. And the fha, uh, brokered deposits and reciprocal deposits. We have an outdated system. Fortunately, we have unwound a system that treated them very, uh, or would have treated them very unfairly in 2024, but it still needs to be updated to enable, uh, the proper use of these tools, which provide a great deal of liquidity. Um, bank mergers are also important on the agenda, and I think that they demonstrate the need and ability of community banks to grow and serve our country. 
>> Gentleman's time has expired. Thank you. Thank you very much. Uh, and we'll get to more of your testimony in q&a. I'm sure. Uh, Mr. Carney, you're now recognized for five minutes. 
>> Chairman, ranking member foster and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on 

[2:38:14 PM]

promoting the health of the banking sector. I am Hugh carney, executive vice president for regulatory affairs at the American bankers association, which represents banks of all sizes and business models across the country. I spent the past 20 years working on prudential regulatory matters, both at the office of the comptroller of the currency and at aba. My remarks today focus on four priorities indexing regulatory thresholds, modernizing the resolution framework, updating funding statutes, and recalibrating capital standards. These changes will make regulations more predictable, transparent, and risk focused, while preserving the vibrancy and competitiveness of the American banking system. For decades, many regulatory thresholds have stayed fixed even as the economy has grown. For example, heightened audit requirements established by the fdic in 1993 become operational when a bank's assets reach 500 million. Back then, it meant the more stringent requirements only applied to 7% of banks. Today it applies to 41%. Dozens of thresholds have drifted the same way. This drift creates 

[2:39:15 PM]

three problems. First, it burdens institutions never meant to be captured. Second, it discourages organic growth, and third, it dilutes regulatory resources. The solution is indexing. Aba recommends, after one time adjustment to correct for past inaction, linking asset based thresholds to nominal gdp, which reflects the size of the economy and the scale of the banking sector. If the fdic is 500 million audit threshold had been indexed, it would be 2.2 billion today. Restoring its original scope. Indexing is a low cost, high impact reform that allows regulators to focus on where the risk really is. We applaud the fdic's recent proposal to index some of its regulatory thresholds, and urge other policymakers to consider this issue, including congress, since some thresholds are set by statute. Shifting to bank resolutions, the bank resolution bank failures of 2023 showed that resolution rules must evolve. Earlier this year, aba formed a task force in deposit insurance and resolution issues. The task force recommends three reforms 

[2:40:16 PM]

to bank resolution policy. First, broaden the least cost tests so regulators can consider costs that a particular bank resolution may impose on the public, including potential costs of contagion and impacts on relevant communities. Second, allow greater community bank participation in failed bank resolutions through consortium bids and flexible evaluation standards. Third, improve transparency in the bidding process by publishing clear qualification criteria and timelines. These changes will help maintain stability, preserve local access to financial services, and reduce long term systemic costs. Funding rules also need to be modernized. One example of an outdated law in need of modernization is the statute governing broker deposits, which has not been updated in over 35 years since the statute was enacted, regulatory, market and technological changes have reconfigured banking and the provision of financial services. The result is that today, a deposit classified as brokered is stigmatized based on an arbitrary interpretation of 

[2:41:16 PM]

what entities are deposit brokers, rather than deposits, actual risk characteristics or bank's broader liquidity risk management. Aba recommends repealing section 29 of the fda and replacing it with a framework that limits asset growth for banks that are less than well capitalized. This preserves the original purpose while allowing healthy banks to gain access to stable, diverse funding sources. Finally, I'd like to address capital. It's important to recognize that capital rules are not just bank rules. They directly affect borrowers, businesses, and the functioning of the capital markets. That is why the 2023 Basel three endgame proposal generated such strong public concern. Mis calibrated capital standards can raise borrowing costs, reduce credit availability and restrict liquidity in the economy. As the agencies reconsider Basel three endgame, we urge a capital neutral framework that removes excess gold plating that has been layered on top of international norms and remove double counting with the stress testing framework. In addition, we encourage rapid finalization of the proposed changes to the 

[2:42:16 PM]

enhanced supplementary leverage ratio to restore it to its role as a backstop. Moreover, we encourage revisiting leverage requirements more generally, including excluding low risk assets from leverage ratio calculations and reducing the community bank leverage ratio to 8% at most. Finally, we recommend recognizing mutual capital certificates as capital without unnecessary compliance burdens. Taken together, indexing, modernizing resolution standards, updating funding policy, and recalibrating capital standards will make the banking industry safer, more competitive, and better equipped to serve customers. Thank you for your attention and I look forward to your questions. 
>> Thank you, doctor Michelle. You're now recognized. 
>> Good afternoon. Chairman. Ranking member, foster members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify at today's hearing. I'm Norbert Michel. I am vice president and director for the cato institute center for monetary and financial alternatives. But the views I expressed in this testimony today are my own and should not be construed as 

[2:43:16 PM]

representing any official position of the cato institute. In my testimony today, I argue that the existing bank regulatory framework creates enormous costs with little perceptible economic benefit for the typical American. Larger firms find it comparatively easier to adapt to the system, so the framework itself creates the incentives for larger firms to grow larger, as also the incentive for smaller firms to petition congress for relief, protection and better rules. For decades now, it has been obvious that there are too many rules and regulations in the banking sector, and that those rules are overly complicated and often counterproductive. It is perfectly understandable that people in the banking and financial industries regularly ask federal officials for a better system. They need clarification of rules, and they naturally want rules tailored to their business models. Their lives depend on working within those rules. So it makes sense that we are here today seeking ways to develop less costly and more effective rules, to fund banks, to 

[2:44:17 PM]

capitalize banks, to compete with banks, to develop rules that are more commensurate with risk and even to do a better job resolving failed banks. These issues are critically important, but the regulatory framework suffers from a much bigger foundational problem. It is driven by the idea that the free enterprise system doesn't really work when it comes to financial markets. In financial markets, supposedly we need prescriptive rules to guarantee safety. And if we can just get the rules right, everything will be fine. There will be very few to no failures or instability or crises. The truth, though, is that if we're going to allow people to take financial risks, something which we must do in a free society, then there is simply no way to compile a set of rules and regulations that guarantees these rosy outcomes. It simply will not work. Much like the advocates of socialism who insist that we just haven't tried the right version of socialism yet, advocates for the current regulatory approach are engaged in an exercise of 

[2:45:17 PM]

wishful thinking that ignores the harmful outcomes. The current approach is guaranteed to create, including those which we're here discussing today. We simply can't have a system based on thousands of prescriptive rules that assumes regulators are infallible. Back it up with virtually endless amounts of both implicit and explicit federal backing, and then expect anything other than the outcomes that we currently have. We justify the system based on securing financial stability, and we've done that for decades, even long before the 2008 financial crisis. And we know that it doesn't work. We use words like panic and contagion and pretend that we can stop people from panicking. But even with the government backing that we have now and prior to 2008, we clearly cannot stop people from panicking. When you build a system based explicitly on maintaining stability, you are effectively saying that the federal government will protect people from losing money. And the only question left is who the government will protect from losing money. And that's 

[2:46:19 PM]

the problem, because then the system helps those people panic, those people who want to make sure that they are not the ones who lose money. It creates the constituencies that seek more backing and it justifies even more rules, thus worsening the problem. We end up pitting ourselves against each other, whether it's Wall Street versus main street, big banks versus small banks, or now big and small banks versus medium sized banks. Nobody should be amazed that we have banks of all sizes wanting different rules, and we can deny it all we want. But the regulatory system that we have created leads directly to this issue. Worse, it gives groups of banks by different clients, different size classes with balance sheets that look virtually identical. It narrows the way people can earn and invest money, and it makes people dependent on the government. That's a fragile system, not a resilient one. But that is the problem that we have created and worsened. If we really want to fix these 

[2:47:19 PM]

things, we need to take a different approach and regulate from the principle that free markets can work even in financial markets. We have to let business owners be business owners and even let bankers be bankers. We have to stop pretending that the free market doesn't work in financial markets. Thank you for your consideration and I'm happy to answer any questions you have. 
>> Thank you. And now, Mr. John James, you are recognized for five minutes. 
>> Thank you. Chairman Barr, chairman hill, ranking member. Foster, ranking member. Waters and members of the subcommittee. Good afternoon. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on promoting the health of the banking sector, reforming resolution and broadening funding access for long term resilience. This hearing comes at a critical time as the administration weighs regulatory reform. Congress should play a critical role in shaping those reforms, ensuring a healthy banking system sector that serves institutions of all sizes. My name is Robert James, 

[2:48:20 PM]

the second president of carver financial corporation, parent of carver state bank of Savannah, Georgia, and bhm bank of Birmingham, Alabama. I'm also immediate past chairman of the national bankers association, which advocates for our nation's minority depository institutions. These mission driven community banks, many also certified cdfi's like carver, are vital sources of strength and engines of economic development and low and moderate income communities. My testimony will focus on access to capital and deposits, fdic insurance reform and regulatory modernization, tier one capital, or the equity invested in a bank, is the most critical component of its resilience and is essential for banks to grow and scale. While mdis maintain adequate capital ratios, limited access to capital over decades has left them undersized for the needs of their communities. Pending legislation before this committee, including the community bank capital flexibility and growth act of 2025 and the promoting and advancing communities of color through inclusive lending act, will help ensure mission driven 

[2:49:21 PM]

banks not only survive, but thrive. Capital alone is not sufficient. Our banks also need access to stable deposits. Community banks deploy deposits to fuel small business growth and afford and provide affordable credit for consumers. We support an all of the above strategy to expand community bank access to core deposits, including regulatory changes, broadened access to federal deposits and partnerships with fintechs, larger banks and other third parties as banking business models evolve and fintech and other third party partnerships begin to play a more prominent role, the laws governing how banks accept and categorize core deposits should evolve, should evolve to. Unfortunately, virtually any third party involvement in connecting banks to deposits results in those deposits being categorized as brokered, triggering supervisory burdens and higher insurance premiums even when they function as core deposits. Updating these rules is vital legislation such as H.R. 3234 to allow well-managed 

[2:50:22 PM]

banks to utilize more reciprocal deposits, and the community bank deposit access act of 2025 are important steps in the right direction. The failure of silicon valley bank highlighted the risks to small businesses when banks collapse abruptly. It also drove funds away from community banks towards bank deemed too big to fail to maintain confidence. The NBA has supported expanding fdic coverage for small business accounts, including a permanent transaction account guarantee program, providing up to $10 million in coverage for payroll and operating deposits. We also support increased coverage on interest bearing accounts, provided smaller banks are not saddled with higher premiums. Efforts to modernize fdic coverage have wide bipartisan support, including from the vice president, who introduced a bill when he was in the senate to reform deposit insurance. Current legislative proposals, such as the failing bank acquisition fairness act and the employee paycheck and small business protection act, warrant serious consideration. 

[2:51:23 PM]

We support the administration's focus on fortifying the financial system, but caution against reforms that overlook community banks regulations must be consistent with national policy goals, such as closing the homeownership gap, supporting small businesses and ensuring financial inclusion, if not, more, activity may migrate outside the regulated banking system, making it harder to manage risk. We urge congress and the administration to fully fund the cdfi fund, which is vital for community investment and streamline data collection, record keeping and reporting to reduce unnecessary burdens on smaller banks. The NBA applauds this subcommittee's attention to these issues. We look forward to working with you on legislation that will strengthen community banks, expand capital and deposits, and ensure regulatory processes align with our shared goals. Strong mission driven community banks mean stronger small businesses, broader homeownership, and lasting economic growth in every community. Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I look 

[2:52:25 PM]

forward to your questions. 
>> Thank you for all of your testimony, and we will now turn to member questions. I will recognize myself initially for five minutes for questioning. Mr. Carney, this committee has repeatedly advocated for the federal banking regulators to tailor regulatory thresholds rather than operate under a one size fits all framework. This ensures that a small bank in rural Kentucky is subject to a set of standards that reflects their own unique size, complexity and business model. What has been the result of regulatory thresholds remaining static while the economy and banking sector grows? 
>> So as banks grow, what we see, what we refer to as regulatory drift and, uh, indexing would allow for a more consistent, risk appropriate framework over time and a static threshold. What it means is as a bank approaches that threshold, they are looking at potentially increased compliance costs if they cross that threshold. So they begin to defensively manage their balance sheets to try and stay under that regulatory threshold 

[2:53:25 PM]

or do what we refer to as jumping a threshold, which is an acquisition to spread those increased compliance costs over a larger institution. Uh, that's not appropriate. That's not a way of, um, it's far better to let a bank grow organically, continue to fund loans in their communities, rather than be forced into those two situations. 
>> Yeah, I've heard from banks of that in the $9 billion category, especially, um, because of durban, another regulatory pressures that trigger up and cfpb supervision at ten. They want to jump really high and really fast in order to deal with that. Um, so indexing these thresholds would create a more dynamic and flexible framework that would keep pace with economic realities. 
>> That is what we're recommending. We're recommending indexing to nominal gdp, which captures the value of goods and services provided. 
>> Okay. Small and mid-size banks rely on access to diverse sources of stable funding to remain competitive. You all testify to this. One of the funding streams is reciprocal 

[2:54:26 PM]

deposits, where banks place deposits into a network between multiple banks, exchanging customer deposits with each other and in amounts below fdic coverage limit. These reciprocal deposits offer a valuable tool for protecting depositors and promoting financial stability. By allowing banks to offer fdic insurance on large deposits while keeping equal funds at their banks. Removing barriers to their use would promote depositor confidence, strengthen funding stability, and enhance overall financial system resilience. I was proud to co-sponsor majority whip emmer and congresswoman beatty's bipartisan H.R. 3234, which would modify the amount of reciprocal deposits that are considered to be non-brokered, permitting greater use of this stable funding source, especially for community banks. Mr. James, you noted in your testimony in a letter that you support this bill. Can you briefly talk about how carver state bank uses reciprocal deposits and why they are important to your institution? 
>> Mr. Chairman, thank you for the question. Um, just before I came into this hearing room, I 

[2:55:26 PM]

had a call with a large wall Street bank that has made a deposit in our institution. Our bank is headquartered in a census tract with over 60% poverty. There is not a lot of, you know, spare cash laying around in that community for us to deploy to grow businesses or make consumer loans available. I was fortunate that the institution that we have this relationship with, which is using a reciprocal deposit product, uh, decided that because of the impact that we're having in the community, they want to increase the amount of that deposit. Those funds will be made directly available to underserved urban and rural communities all across the state of Georgia and now into Alabama. As we've acquired an institution there, it's very important that we be able to insource capital from higher net worth individuals or corporations or municipalities in order to make capital and credit available in the communities that we serve. 
>> Yeah, that's a great example. Mr. Burris, could you explain how increasing limits for well rated financial institutions before reciprocal deposits are 

[2:56:27 PM]

considered brokered, could support community banks in securing stable funding? 
>> Thank you. Chairman. Um, sure. Absolutely. There are institutions all over the country who are heavily reliant on relationships with partners or large depositors, where they need the ability to, uh, use an interface or similar system for reciprocal deposits to be able to fund their activities. Um, increasingly, those enterprises, uh, do business with partners that are subject to scrutiny, uh, under systems that that essentially penalize those deposits and, uh, it impairs their ability to have consistent and stable funding. So, uh, flexibility on reciprocal deposits is crucial for smaller institutions to be able to fund, uh, the activities in their communities. 
>> My time is expiring. But on a on a related note, the regulatory treatment of broker deposits has been in limbo 

[2:57:28 PM]

since the Biden era. Fdic moved to rescind a framework implemented under the trump administration. Uh, so it's important that congress restore stability in this broker deposits regulatory regime. Uh, with that, uh, the gentleman from Illinois, uh, Mr. Foster, doctor foster is now recognized for five minutes. 
>> Thank you. Chair. To our witnesses, um, Mr. James and president trump's first budget request, he included a proposal to largely wind down the cdfi fund, characterizing as a quote unquote program. I disagree with this assessment, and as do a bipartisan group of 26 senators who urge the administration to release hundreds of millions of dollars of discretionary funds. These senators represent a diverse group of states of both urban and rural communities, that benefit from the work of cdfis. Could you briefly discuss the history of the cdfi fund and and whether the program has helped, in particular farmers, small businesses and families in rural areas? 
>> Uh, thank you. Uh, Mr. Ranking member. Um, the cdfi 

[2:58:29 PM]

fund is a program that has enjoyed wide bipartisan support on both sides of congress. Um, we, uh, became a cdfi shortly after the cdfi fund opened up certifications in the year 2000. Um, in just the past five years, we've deployed over $170 million of, uh, resources directly into communities in urban and rural communities across our state. Um, I looked at a map this morning, and we've made investments in the last five years, in 12 out of the 14 congressional districts in the state of Georgia, and our institution is $130 million institution. So we're punching way above our weight class. A lot of that is due to the resources that we are provided by the cdfi fund. We've used that those investments to create nearly 8000 jobs across the state of Georgia in both urban and rural communities. And I think you'll see similar results from other cdfis all across the country. 
>> Yeah, and obviously none of that would happen if the cdfi 

[2:59:29 PM]

fund was wound down as recommended. Um, Mr. James, also, following the collapse of silvergate silicon valley and first republic banks in 2023, I think the regulators and members of this committee were shocked at the speed at which the events unfolded. As I mentioned in my testimony, svb depositors attempted to withdraw nearly $40 billion to the bank in under 48 hours, leading to its failure. I'm very concerned that we're going to see similar situations play out in the future, as social media and digital banking technology increase the rate that deposits can move. I also worry that artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence agents will make the situation even worse with ai agents, given the ability to move funds at the first sign of trouble. In fact, that will be part of their fiduciary responsibility to get your money the heck out of any bank through which there is even a rumor that it's in trouble. Uh, do you share this concern? And do you think that deposit insurance reform or a greater reliance on reciprocal deposits or or what are your recommendations for an 

[3:00:29 PM]

effective curbs against these ai driven bank runs? 
>> Uh, thanks again for that. For that question. I do share, uh, some concern with regard to the speed of implementation of technology. And, and I really hope that our regulatory system can try to keep up with it and evolve. Um, and so I believe that, you know, increasing our ability to rely on reciprocal deposits, such as the example that I, that I mentioned earlier, um, is really important for community banks to remain competitive for larger deposits. I also think that fdic insurance reform, uh, to index, you know, insurance coverage or to protect those transaction accounts so that our small business customers don't, you know, quote unquote, outgrow us, uh, and maintain their deposits with us here in the local communities is very, very important. Um, so while I do share some concern with regard to the rapidity of technological change, I also think that we need to embrace technology in order to provide smaller community banks with access to broader, uh, sources 

[3:01:33 PM]

of deposits so that they can provide liquidity into communities. 
>> Um, Mr. Carney, um, in recent hearing, my staff and I have thought a lot about the various regulatory thresholds, and this is something I remember back at the time we were writing dodd-frank, uh, arguing about what the threshold for too big to fail is and arguing at the time for a fraction of gdp as a thing that would scale, which is what you reference. On the other hand, if you're talking about things like the damage, financial damage to an individual consumer from an abuse or something like that, the threshold there might be, um, scaled with just normal inflation rather than gdp. So could you discuss a little bit about the pros and cons of those two different metrics? 
>> Generally, as the discussions have been going on ongoing? Uh, there are three areas that folks are looking at. One is inflation, which is a captures price. Uh, the second is nominal gdp, which is what aba is recommending. And the third is total bank assets, nominal gdp. For an asset 

[3:02:33 PM]

threshold perspective, uh, we believe is the most appropriate measure because it captures a broader set of goods and services produced, and that represents the role of the banking sector in the broader economy. If it is a consumer facing, uh, regulation, then inflation may be the best measure. 
>> Uh, gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from Arkansas, chairman hill, is now recognized. Thank you. 
>> Mr. Chairman, and thanks to our panel for a really a great, informative set of witnesses to help us in our work. I want to start out and talk initially about, uh, trying to bring resolution to the least cost resolution mandate. This was written back when I was a treasury official in 1991, so I'm familiar with it. Having lived through the snl crisis, uh, both in the private sector and the public sector, we know, uh, that it was meant to tackle the open bank assistance, obviously, of the of the 80s. 

[3:03:35 PM]

But when we look at the more recent banking conditions, the bank failures of 2023 showed many gaps and sort of pitfalls around the fdic's overall resolution process. It seemed to be kind of creaky, not very up to speed, uh, as it was 20 or 30 years ago, the trend of depositors fleeing to the nation's largest banks that enjoy an implicit guarantee for bank deposits is not a sustainable issue, and it's antithetical to a healthy industry. So, Mr. Bracey, I want to start with you. We attached to this hearing a discussion draft about the issue of lease costs resolution. Basically, it would allow the fdic to approve an alternative bid in the case of a resolution of a bank that, uh, if the cost of the alternative bid is less than the cost of liquidating the bank doesn't exceed the cost of the least costly bid by more than a certain percentage that the regulators would think 

[3:04:36 PM]

through, and that the fdic determines that the additional cost is mitigated. This is the key point, from my point philosophy, that would limit further consolidation, increasing competition in the banking. Uh, do you think this kind of amendment deserves consideration? Uh. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think that absolutely deserves consideration. And I think, you see, in the recent past a very disturbing trend where the bank with the biggest balance sheet on the day of the bid wins the bid. And you, you've seen it, uh, in, in 23. And it's a problem. And the least cost process is not considering the costs of diminished competition or costs over an extended period of time. As a result, I think there are a host of things that should be able to be done, including what you're describing. I can tell you from firsthand experience that we were involved in advising potential buyers and or investors in some of the banks that failed in early 23 and in 

[3:05:38 PM]

some cases, had capital sources available on the sidelines to come in and help and weren't considered because we didn't have the biggest balance sheet on the day of the bid. 
>> And yet we routinely in these bank failure situations, waive the deposit cap, which is also a 1980s special, where we basically said to the biggest banks in the country, you can't have more than 10% of your deposits. So we've kind of regulated that, and yet we waive it all the time. Uh, another attached bill to this hearing would restrict the circumstances under which bank regulators can waive that nationwide deposit cap and liability concentration limits, requiring them to prioritize bids to comply with existing concentration rules. Again, similar to my question. First question, do you think that would be a possible situation and limit the growth of too big to fail institutions? 
>> Uh, I do, I think that's a smart and tailored solution that limits the the growth that 

[3:06:38 PM]

we see daily on too big to fail and there's already enough, uh, trans transformation into that space as it is of deposit. 
>> You know, in the, in those, in those bad days of a lot of failures between the snls and commercial banks from, say, 1980 to 1996, we had a lot of expertise at the fdic, inside and outside. We had a lot of experience, and they kept lists of people who could provide capital. So, Mr. Wiley, let me turn to you. You're in the investment banking business for banks. You know, non-bank capital, I think should be play a major role here in this idea. We also have a proposal for shelf, uh, charters where people can come together a bank and non-banks and bring capital into a resolution situation. Do you think that that would benefit the regulators to have an idea of a pre-approved shelf charter concept to help find more bidders? 
>> Uh, yes, Mr. Chairman. Um, uh, you know, from the 80s and early 90s, we learned a lot of 

[3:07:38 PM]

lessons, a lot of failures, and there was no capital available back then, if you remember. But there were plenty of problem banks. Well, there's plenty of capital today. And what's interesting about all those banks that failed in 23 is that at one point they were all very prime investment banks. In other words, investable opportunities. They were they traded at high multiples. They were very profitable. They did very well. They made some mistakes, most of them asset liability management type. All they needed was capital. Yeah. They had great they were great institutions. All they needed this capital. It was very sad to just see it flipped over to a money center for. 
>> Appreciate appreciate that appreciate the increase in competition and these good ideas. I yield back to you, Mr. Chairman. 
>> Gentleman yields gentleman from Georgia. Mr. Scott is now recognized. 
>> Thank you. Chairman. Uh, Mr. John James, now, I'm kind of disturbed about this. Why do you believe that the president would do such a thing to take 

[3:08:42 PM]

and to cut $291 million from the CFD? I, I it's a bipartisan deal. It's much needed. It's very critical to both the rural and urban parts of our district and most importantly, to the lower income and middle income individuals of this nation. And I'm real frustrated about that. You know, um, and the president is a very smart man. He went to the Wharton school of finance. I did too, uh, we were there at the same time. But this really disturbs me. Why do you think he did this? 
>> Mr. Scott, thank you so much 

[3:09:44 PM]

for your question. Um, you know, I, I do want to just acknowledge the broad bipartisan support for the cdfi fund. Um, you know, the cdfi caucus on the United States senate side has an equal number of a number of Republican and democratic members. Uh, I think that you're correct in articulating the wide and deep impact of the cdfi fund, uh, across urban and rural communities across the country. Our institution, uh, is a, you know, great user of cdfi resources in order to deploy capital in underserved communities. Uh, and I just also want to acknowledge that I do know that the secretary of the treasury, uh, Mr. Besson is a is a big supporter of the cdfi fund and has and has announced his support for our institutions and continued funding for the cdfis. 
>> Yeah. Now has the administration, uh, proposed 

[3:10:45 PM]

any type of alternative mechanism to generate, uh, the same scale of private investment, particularly to the underserved communities, the very group that needs the help the most? 
>> Well, I do know that, you know, generally speaking, if you look at the, uh, leverage power of cdfi funding, typically cdfis are going to leverage those dollars, uh, 8 to 1. So for every dollar that's expended by the cdfi fund, uh, there's going to be an eight times leverage of that funding, uh, which really is an ideal public private partnership, uh, where the public sector puts in a certain amount. But the private sector dollars that are coming from these institutions is really leveraged eight fold in order to have impact in communities. And so I haven't seen an alternative proposal that would have greater impact than the 

[3:11:46 PM]

cdfi fund. And we continue to encourage broad, the broad bipartisan support of the fund and encourage the administration to, uh, listen to members of their party as well as, uh, democratic members with regard to support for the cdfi fund. 
>> Yeah. And let's take, for example, very needed but yet vulnerable group. And that's first time homebuyers. Uh, what's going to help them? Uh, and this is particularly true that in the president's fiscal year 2016 budget proposal to eliminate cdphe fund programs used by credit unions like the fha and the to, how will that impact first home buyers? Yeah. With this. So in a way yeah. 
>> In addition to the cdfi fund, of course first time home 

[3:12:46 PM]

buyers are impacted by, you know, lack of access to capital with small community banks as well as, uh, limitations on liquidity. And so I think it's in all of the above approach, you know, we certainly support continued funding for cdfis, but we also really want to make sure that we have access to other sources of capital as well as liquidity. 
>> Well, we're going to continue to fight this, uh, both Democrats and Republicans. A lot of very needy people, whether they be white, black, rural or it is truly an American program to help Americans from every single walk of life. We got to find help for them. 
>> Gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Huizenga, is now recognized. 
>> Thank you, chairman Barr. 
>> And, uh, this brings. 
>> Me back to, uh, our. 
>> Work last congress when I was chair of odni and oversight 

[3:13:47 PM]

and investigations. And you, as we were looking at the bank failures and things that, uh, had gone on there and obviously part of that investigation into the bank failures of svb and signature bank, uh, it became abundantly clear, I think, to all of us that regulators were unprepared, uh, at that time, um, we found in our investigations that the fdic ultimately picked winners and losers when it came to resolving these bank failures, sometimes very last minute. Um, and we heard stories about not being able to get a decision made and, uh, and having it be very late, uh, in this and, um, that I think leads to a more difficult outcome, uh, for the banking system. But, doctor Michel, I'm going to start with you. Uh, I've long advocated that non-bank should have the equal opportunity to purchase failed bank assets in the time of crisis. Something that I believe you just wrote about, 

[3:14:49 PM]

uh, recently. And when you said, quote, there is no good reason that anyone at the fdic should be able to decide winners and losers by making it more difficult for non-banks to purchase failed banks. All Americans are paying for this mess as well as fdic insurance, and they're not banks. Uh, close quote. And so during our investigation, we both bank executives and non bank market participants, this is what we heard time and time again that the fdic was slow to react and that when they did act and react, they created a scenario that allowed them to use the systemic risk exemption in that. So my question to you is kind of two part. Do you believe that the decision by the fdic to dismiss non-banks from purchasing svb or signature ultimately increased the cost to the insurance fund? And then, uh, in the concept of private non-bank investors bidding for failed banks? Uh, that's not really a new concept. Correct. So expound on that a little bit, if you would. 
>> Sure. I certainly think that it increased the cost of the 

[3:15:50 PM]

overall resolution. Uh, whether it was the specifically to the diff, I would have to defer. I suspect that it did raise the cost. Um, it's not a new concept, and I think it's sort of, um, the, the hesitancy to to blur the line, if you will, between, uh, say securities or capital markets and banking. It's sort of a holdover from the glass-steagall era. Uh, it's not helpful. It wasn't a good idea then. Uh, there's a lot of economic research that shows that the banks that were mixed with capital markets firms were actually safer and sounder and and better capitalized and better able to withstand, uh, turmoil. And there's really no economic reason to think that that wouldn't still be the case now. So, yeah, it's not at all helpful. It's not economically sound. 
>> Uh, I'm in writing because I'm down to two minutes. I'm going to ask you to expound on the why do you think it, uh, was that way? And you. I think you were touching on it, but 

[3:16:51 PM]

we'll we'll send that question to you. 
>> Okay. 
>> What created that that situation? Um, I do want to kind of take, uh, jumping off spot from where chairman hill was when it comes to bank resolution, regulators were given certain tools after the oh eight financial crisis. Uh, and do you believe they effectively use those tools during the 2023, for example, federal regulators could have used orderly liquidation authority in 2023, but they chose not to any. Anyone care to weigh in on that? 
>> It's a mystery. 
>> Mystery. Kind of a shrug, huh? Had the tools, just didn't use it. Okay, well, all right, Mr. Mr. Masari, uh, sorry. Uh, one of the potential missed opportunities during the run of bank failures in 2023 was the purchase of first republic bank by JP Morgan chase, one of the largest banks in the world became larger. In addition, we heard stories of deposit fleeing community financial institutions to safer ground in the, quote, too big to fail banks. This put these smaller 

[3:17:52 PM]

institutions at a competitive disadvantage. Do you think allowing community and regional banks to merge would help promote competition with the larger banks, which have gained more of the market share post dodd-frank? 
>> No question. Thank you for the question. Uh, congressman Huizenga, no question that allowing smaller and regional banks to merge would provide for greater competition, uh, with larger institutions. Uh, we have a problem right now where you see mid-size banks getting hollowed out, uh, and, and they need to be recreated through the combination of some regional banks and smaller banks to facilitate a good competitive environment. 
>> And that ultimately should be what it's about a competitive environment that allows the customer the best product and the best opportunities and the freedom of choice on how they're going to do their banking, in my humble opinion. So, uh, with that, my, uh, yield back my time as. 
>> Chairman yields gentleman from California, Mr. Vargas is recognized. 
>> Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity. Again, I want to 

[3:18:52 PM]

thank the witnesses for being here. Mr. Bracey, we have your curriculum vitae here, and we also heard from you, um, you started off main street banks. You went to the super regional bank and talked about the banking system here being the envy of the world and the engine of economic growth. And we need to be able to move quickly. What about crypto? Is it something that is going to allow us to move quickly? Is it safe for banks? Is there a problem there? Is there a risk there? You're the bank. You're the only banker, you're the attorney. Could you comment on that? Sure. 
>> First, thank you for the question. I think there are risks with all financial products. I think the action that congress took recently to adopt the genius act was, was a good action to take a measured approach with respect to crypto. Um, the the issuers of payment stablecoins would not be permitted to be financial institutions. And I think that's a smart decision. 

[3:19:54 PM]

>> Did we pick winners or losers there? 
>> No, I don't think that you pick winners or losers with respect to the genius act so far. I would also note that, uh, we have a long way to go before. 
>> Didn't put. 
>> Banks at a disadvantage. I mean, we hear from banks now, some of them say that they were placed in a disadvantage. Uh. 
>> I would say that there are questions about whether that will cause migration of deposits. And we'll see what happens with respect to remaining legislation and regulation. And I think that there's a long way to go before the regulations ultimately seen. Okay. 
>> Uh. 
>> Doctor Michelle, good to see you again. Um, same question for you. I mean, you you heard about picking winners and losers? Uh, did remember I think cato commented. You could comment if you'd like, on the government taking 10% position on Intel. I mean, we're picking winners or losers there. 
>> Uh, that one's pretty clear. 

[3:20:56 PM]

Yeah. 
>> So. 
>> Uh, no, I'm surprisingly, uh, no, I'm not a fan of that decision. 
>> Mean, I, I find that interesting, but I, you know, I respect your, um, and that you're very ideologically driven. I do have the question and the same question for you. What about crypto? The bill that we passed, did we pick winners and losers there? 
>> Um, well, I mean, I don't think anything is perfect. Any bill is perfect, I don't think I think crypto is is a broad term. I think we'd have to be careful with how we would use with what we're exactly what we're talking about. I think stablecoins, for example, if we're talking about, uh, fully backed stablecoins as a payment option, I don't see any reason to say that, uh, that by itself is overly risky and should be kept out of the banking system, whether it's through a relationship, uh, where a bank is providing a fintech company with a relationship, or whether it's a bank providing the the stablecoin. Uh, no, I would, I would blend I have no trouble blending that. Okay. 
>> Fair enough. I do have to 

[3:21:57 PM]

say that little comment aside. I mean, I do find it interesting, my colleagues on the other side, um, often talk about not picking winners or losers, and yet they seem to be fine with Intel. Uh, I don't seem to hear a comment out of them. Uh, little peep. I do hear it from, you know, ideological groups. So I think it's appropriate would be appropriate to maybe if we heard it from some on the other side. I think the the base might be a little tough on them because of, uh, who's in favor of that? But moving on. Um. In the context of the rural areas of Georgia and other places, I mean, everybody thinks it's an urban thing, but that's not true. It's both. Right. 
>> Uh, thank you, Mr. Vargas. The vast majority are, or I would say not maybe vast, but the majority of cdphe resources are directed towards rural communities across the country. I think that's something that, um, is, is very clear. If you look at the membership again of the cdphe caucus on the senate side, you see members from both, 

[3:22:58 PM]

um, you know, highly urbanized states as well as very rural states, uh, because of recognition that rural communities actually, uh, have an outsized benefit from the cdfi fund, um, our institution again, you know. We're reaching those underserved rural communities as well with resources that we have been able to win from the cdfi fund. 
>> Thank you. I have about 20s left. So I want to say it's interesting when you talk about dei or cdfis, everybody talks about urban communities. And yet we hear a lot of the damage it does in rural communities when you do away with these programs. So anyway, with that, I thank the chair and I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Williams, is now recognized. 
>> Thank you very much. And thank you all for being here today. And one of the main issues I hear from lenders every day back in Texas is how regulatory costs are squeezing community and regional banks from capital requirements that, uh, that don't reflect the bank's true risk profile, duplicative reporting and 

[3:23:58 PM]

liquidity standards. Smaller institutions are spending more and more time and money on compliance instead of serving their customers. And static thresholds on one size fits all frameworks force main street lenders to divert resources away from. Bill. Uh, can you discuss some of the costs that burdensome regulations have on the broader economy, whether you think the volumes of regulations even make the financial system more stable? 
>> Sure. I mean, anything any service that a bank is going to provide or any other financial company is going to be providing, uh, you'll have less of it, uh, the higher the cost that you implement or that you force onto the bank or the financial company. So that is a cost. Sometimes that's difficult to measure because it's the absence of something. Um, but we know, for example, in Mr. James communities, you know, there's, there's an issue with, with banks being able to serve their communities. And one of those reasons is certainly regulatory cost. Um, it's not easy to comply with, 

[3:24:59 PM]

uh, banking regulation writ large. And many of the specific pieces of it as well. 
>> Yeah. Thank you. The bank resolution process plays an important role in protecting depositors and maintaining confidence in. Transparency in the building. In the bidding process, it can limit the options available for healthy institutions, step and continue serving their customers and communities so that can make it harder to preserve a diverse and competitive banking system. So, uh, Mr. Breezy, I was interested in your discussion of the need for the fdic to evaluate the capital capacity of potential buyers more thoroughly, which could expand the pool of potential buyers to include smaller and regional banks. So how can congress reform the bank resolution process to ensure it supports competition and avoids accelerating consolidation in the industry? 
>> Thank you, congressman, for the question. Um, I do think there are several things that the fdic could do to, uh, provide more competition in connection with failed bank process. Um, and I think you 

[3:26:01 PM]

could direct it to be, uh, more flexible in its activity with respect to least cost resolution. As one illustration, um, I think. Process, I mentioned maintenance of live data rooms that would contain the kind of information that people like Mr. Wiley would, uh, advise them on maintaining. And, uh, also, frankly, the fdic using technology and tools to help not only, uh, identify and resolve situations that create risk, um, but also to help identify buyers and, and, uh, the, the paired offerings by, by multiple institutions or institutions of capital. 
>> Yeah. Thank you. Uh, Mr. Carney, uh, custodial deposits have become an increasingly important tool, especially as more businesses look for efficient ways to manage funds on behalf of customers. For banks, these accounts offer low cost, of reliable source of funding, and for businesses, 

[3:27:02 PM]

they provide the convenience of pooling client money in one place with the added protection of deposit insurance. So at a time when community and regional banks are competing for stable funding. How custodial deposits are a way for regional and community banks to have access to additional sources of low cost funding. 
>> So. So custodial deposits are a form of funding that is, uh, appealing to many institutions. But we think that the biggest problem with the deposit framework right now is the treatments of broker deposits, where it's a treatment that is just fundamentally, um, outdated and hasn't been updated in over 35 years. When the broker deposit framework was first put in place, banks advertised through newspapers. Uh, the internet was in its infancy and iPhones didn't exist. And so we're really trying to focus as much attention as possible on the removal of section 29 of the 

[3:28:02 PM]

fda, uh, and replacing it with a restrictions on asset growth for less than well-capitalized banks. 
>> Um, the gentlewoman from California, the ranking member, miss waters, is now recognized. 
>> Thank you very much. Uh, my question will be directed to Mr. James following the regional bank failures in 2023, including silicon valley bank. Uh, it quickly became apparent that our deposit insurance framework needed to be updated. Small businesses have enough to do. Uh, they should not have to be a bank regulator and figure out if they're federally regulated. Bank could suddenly fail, especially if another bank failed. At a minimum, they should be able to maintain their payroll and operating funds at a bank and be assured 

[3:29:03 PM]

that they can still pay their workers, even if their bank suddenly closes. Furthermore. Taking emergency action, there have been at least 37 smaller bank failures since 2007, including one in Oklahoma just last year where no emergency tools were used and small businesses lost money through no fault of their own. That's why I introduced H.R. 4551, the employee paycheck and small business protection act, to improve emergency tools and require the fdic and ncua to take a data driven approach to expand deposit insurance to not only protect small businesses and their workers, but allow their smaller lenders and mid-size banks to compete for these deposits. Other Republicans agree, with treasury secretary Bessent 

[3:30:04 PM]

voicing support for reform and similar proposals introduced by senators bill. When he was in senate. Mr. James, it has been about 15 years since congress last updated our deposit insurance framework. What do you think? Should we expand it? As I have proposed to help community banks, small businesses and their workers. 
>> Ranking member waters, thank you so much for your question. Um, and thank you for, uh, authoring the employee paycheck and small business protection act. Uh, we're very large, very major supporters of that legislation to modernize fdic insurance coverage, as well as other approaches to ensure that small community lenders have access to more liquidity. It's very important that our institutions are able to insource capital, um, many of the institutions that our member banks serve, uh, are the 

[3:31:04 PM]

lower income communities that are serving both rural and urban communities across the country. And. Innovating within our communities and growing because of the capital that we're investing in them. We want to be able to keep those customers. We want to be able to not have them outgrow us. So, uh, the fdic insurance coverage should, should, should modernize so that we can keep those customers with us instead of, you know, essentially pushing them towards these banks that have been deemed too big to fail. 
>> Well, thank you very much. I've heard when I came in some discussion about cdfis and you know, uh, the city of ise and mdis has been a bipartisan affair for many years, and I'm very much involved in trying to strengthen rather the cdfis even in trump's first term, Republicans and Democrats worked together to ensure these community financial institutions could support underserved communities. Congresswoman Velasquez and I, 

[3:32:06 PM]

with former treasury secretary mnuchin, we worked with him. And mdis to provide paycheck protection program loans to small businesses. We work together with congressional Republicans to secure 12 billion in capital investments for cdfis and mdis. Unfortunately, now the white house is seeking to undermine the progress, including withholding funds that congress previously appropriated. In case my colleagues have forgotten, cdfis operate in all 50 states and have issued over 19 million loans totaling more than 300 billion, supporting underserved communities in rural and urban areas alike, and are ignored by traditional banks. Mr. James, has the cdfi fund been a good investment for taxpayers? Would you briefly discuss how cdfis have helped borrowers in rural communities? 
>> Uh, ranking member waters? Yes. Cdfi funds have, uh, the 

[3:33:06 PM]

cdfi fund has been an excellent investment for taxpayers. Um, and I want to. Access to capital and resources for cdfis and the president for signing that legislation into law. Uh, the most historic investment in cdfis in the nation's history has had an enormous impact in urban and rural communities, job creation, as well as home ownership and access to capital. 
>> The gentlelady's time has expired. The gentleman from Georgia, the vice chair of the subcommittee, Mr. Loudermilk, is now recognized for five minutes. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Carney, how. 
>> Do banks typically. 
>> Adjust their behavior. 
>> As they. Approach regulatory threshold. 
>> And what are the broader implications of this dynamic? 
>> So as banks approach regulatory threshold, they're looking at increased compliance costs as they cross that threshold. And so oftentimes defensively manage their balance sheets to try and stay underneath that threshold. Or they what we say is jump a 

[3:34:10 PM]

threshold where they. Broader institution. Uh what this does though is it inhibits organic growth, which is really what you want to see. Uh, with a bank. Um, it also dilutes regulatory resources because the more banks that cross a threshold, the more scrutiny the regulators are having to give, and that dilutes their focus. 
>> All right. Let me follow under that, dodd-frank is one size fits all approach has been one of the most one of its most criticized aspects mid-size regional and small community banks, which did not contribute to the financial crisis, have been subject to subjected to the same regulatory regime designed for the largest, most complex financial institutions. My Taylor act would require federal regulators to tailor their regulations in accordance with the size, business model and risk of each type of firm they regulate. Can you speak to the impact that an approach like the Taylor act would have on these mid-size, regional and small community banks? 
>> I think it would be very 

[3:35:10 PM]

beneficial. Aba has. Not uh, it is complementary, I think, to the indexing, uh, approach that we're recommending. Uh, the two can work together. 
>> Okay. Thank you. Uh, doctor Michelle, what can congress do to streamline and improve the bank resolution process, to promote competition, broaden participation, and prevent industry consolidation? 
>> Well, the more radical approach would be to get it out of the fdic. Uh, you know, bankruptcy is supposed to be an orderly resolution of a company, and there's really no economic reason not to do that. Um, fdic deposit insurance is the reason that we do it the way we do it. Um, but, you know, if you're in regular bankruptcy and you take your money out of a company really fast before the judge gets to go in and resolve the company, you have to bring it back. So you know that that could theoretically still work. That would be one way to do it. And if you're not going to do it that way, I understand why. 

[3:36:10 PM]

Um, you know, but then there's. Non-bank companies or non-bank financial companies get involved in bidding processes. Um, a lot of the way that this is driven is specifically to combine a larger and a smaller bank to make the asset size larger, uh, and theoretically sounder. But that's not necessarily the case. Um, but that is historically what has happened. And, and I think, honestly, the systemic risk exception is a mistake. Um, you know, if you're if you're going to resolve the bank, resolve the bank, if stability is the reason that you're regulating, uh, then an open bank resolution, although it was disastrous from a cost standpoint in the 90s with the snl crisis and open bank resolution is the way to do that. 
>> But so what would be your recommendation to congress on. 
>> What to do? I would take the all of the above approach. 
>> Okay. 
>> All right. Thank you. Mr. Wiley. Are there ways that you think the fdic could improve the bidding process? Yes, sir. 

[3:37:18 PM]

>> Pardon me. Yeah. How can they improve the bidding process? Well, one, I think they need to take their time a little bit more. The speed is essential when there's deposit runs. But at the same time, um, this is where I have a little bit of a problem with the least cost initiative that comes in. I think it misses the point of what's best for the overall system. When we put all the deposits at risk, these large deposits, um, then it adversely hurts the smaller community banks versus the larger banks, which are too big to fail. So the resolution needs to take that into account. There's been less than $1 billion. I think the fdic has had to, uh, force, uh, to eat on large deposits over time because they tend to get it back. Is it really worth it? So, you know, there's. 
>> A lot. 
>> Was ought to be in the resolution process. But at the end of the day, the best, uh, 

[3:38:22 PM]

legislation ever enacted was the fdic insurance. It stabilized economies for all time. And we're fine tuning it. We have to remember that's a that's a system of confidence. It's about confidence. And so when we can introduce more competition in take delays, use bridge banks like they did in late 80s uh shelf charters and things like that. I think you'll have better results. 
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
>> The gentleman yields the gentleman from California. Mr. Sherman is now recognized. 
>> Thank you. Thank you. For holding this hearing. 
>> I know. 
>> We're focused a bit on silicon valley bank and its resolution. We shouldn't. Lose track of why it failed. It failed because we didn't deal with interest rate risk. And we still don't. And we do not. And it's available for sale, uh, bonds. And as long as we don't do that, we have perverse 

[3:39:23 PM]

incentives where a bank can invest in long term instruments, sell them at a profit if they go up or hide the loss if they go down. And that creates a perverse. 
>> Uh. 
>> Incentive for executives and, uh, and board members, uh, the least cost method of resolving an institution, um, butts up against our desire to have to give an advantage to smaller banks if they're bidding on some or all of the assets. But keep in mind, if you increase the cost. 
>> That cost. 
>> Then has to be borne by all the banks in the country through increased fdic premiums that are ultimately passed on. All banks, with our desire not. 
>> To have. 
>> These additional costs incurred. Um, a lot of this hearing is about brokered 

[3:40:25 PM]

deposits, whether that be reciprocal, which is in effect, a brokered deposit or the traditional brokered deposit. Uh, we're not focused much here on just increasing the $250,000 limit. But in effect, brokered deposits do just that. 
>> Uh, so. 
>> Our rule will be going forward. The limit is kept at $250,000. Unless there's a middleman who can make a profit, um, by splitting it up and sending it to a bunch of institutions. Um, Mr. Whealy, I believe is, uh, talks about, uh, us not having a threshold. On the other hand, if you're going to have separate rules for smaller institutions and larger institutions, you got to have a threshold between them. I'd like to see us have more than one cap. From category a to category Z, but we simultaneously are told to have not one size fits all, but to have special rules for smaller banks. Now we're being told, 

[3:41:27 PM]

well, when a smaller bank becomes larger, um, we, uh, we shouldn't apply the standards that we have for banks of that size. Uh, Mr. Carney, uh, do your members find value in the flexible terms? Uh, available from the regional home loan banks in their area? 
>> Uh, yes. Uh, banks fall sizes have very good relationship with the federal home loan bank system, and it serves a critical role in liquidity. 
>> Thank you. And I'd like to note that the recent bipartisan national housing crisis task force action plan, released in June, showcased the importance of community development financial institutions. In addressing housing affordability. Um, we don't have anyone here, I believe, from the credit union, uh, side of things. But I would just 

[3:42:27 PM]

point out that we need to have parity. What we do for banks should also be done for the credit unions. Um. The, uh, senators Hagerty and, uh, uh, uh, Alyssa brooks, uh, have offered, uh, ndaa amendment to increase uh, uh, deposit insurance and insurance up to 20 million for non-interest bearing transactions accounts. Uh, Mr. Carney, uh, is that a movement in the right direction to allow, uh, small and medium size banks to continue to hold on to, uh, businesses, uh, as, uh, as they get? 
>> Uh, legislation? Instead, we've developed a series of recommendations that focus on fdic emergency authorities, uh, studying increased deposit insurance levels, uh, and, um, 

[3:43:28 PM]

and reforming the resolution framework. Uh, we think that bills that are being introduced are useful discussion points. Uh, and it's worth having the discussion now while we're not in a crisis situation. 
>> Thank you. I'll yield back the last eight seconds. 
>> The gentleman from Tennessee, Mr. Rose, is now recognized. 
>> Thank you, chairman and ranking member foster, for holding this important hearing. And thanks to our witnesses for taking time to be with us today. 
>> I want to highlight the issue of limited banking access for independent atm operators. Uh, many have reported difficulty in establishing and maintaining. A higher money laundering risk, despite little or no evidence to substantiate that. Additionally, some have lost long standing bank accounts without clear explanation, often due to 

[3:44:28 PM]

overly cautious compliance practices. It is crucial to address and prevent the debunking of independent atm operators. In my opinion, Mr. Carney would. The American bankers association support requiring merging banks to demonstrate how their post-merger compliance framework will balance anti-money laundering obligations with the statutory duty to meet the convenience and needs of lawful businesses, such as independent atm operators? 
>> Okay. Uh, so I think there are two components of that question. Uh, one, for the first part, uh, banks that are going through a merger are complying with bsa requirements before. It's a very interesting point related to compliance, bsa compliance and access to financial services. And the rules on the bsa side are very much outdated. They are, um, more focused on cash transactions than anything else, 

[3:45:30 PM]

which does raise some flags with those independent operators that you are talking about. But it's worth mentioning that over 20 million ctrs annually are filed. That's one out of every 16 Americans, which is an extremely high amount. Uh, the net is capturing too much, and I think there needs to be an evaluation of whether or not those levels are set at the right level. 
>> Okay. Thank you, Mr. Carney. Roughly what percent of American bankers association members currently provide banking services to independent atm operators? 
>> I don't have that information, but I can try and find it. 
>> Yes, if you please will, and maybe respond in writing as we move forward. To entire industries like independent atm operators without individualized risk assessments be reflected negatively in their ratings during merger reviews. 
>> Well, given the bank secrecy act requirements, uh, I'd have 

[3:46:31 PM]

to say no. That's not really fair. I think the problem I think really that is the core of the problem. It's the bsa. Uh, it's overly broad. Uh, a lot of discretion there. And we know that it's not, it's it's it's, uh, it's catching up a lot more people in a dragnet than it than than are actually criminals. Uh, that's that's I think the base of the problem, really, or the core of the problem. It's not the banks, it's not the atms. It's the bank secrecy act. 
>> Sure. I guess I would to maybe give a little background here. I had worked on this issue during the time I've been in congress. And, um, former congressman Blaine Luetkemeyer and former congresswoman. Getting the prudential regulators to amend the ffiec examination manual to note specifically that independent atm operators do not present an extraordinary risk. And then ultimately, we we were able to to get each of the regulators 

[3:47:32 PM]

that participate in the ffiec to note in specific to their examiners that this was not the case. And yet we continue to see banks, uh, banking independent atm operators. So it's a very real concern to me. And, and while I hear what you're saying about the bank secrecy act, I think there should be sufficient guidance at this point to banks that there should not be a categorical, um, disadvantage given to, uh, customers who operate independent atm networks. Um, Mr. Burr, the the bank merger act requires consideration of anti-money. Overzealous in applying those rules in ways that result in broad denial of services to lawful industries like atm operators. 
>> I think in in again, in this atm operator case, it's a difficult case and I don't know 

[3:48:32 PM]

enough about the atm operator. And I think bsa aml compliance is a is a real issue. Um, I in my view, the regulatory analysis that has historically occurred in connection with bank mergers is is plenty robust in its current form. And, um, I would not look to expand that. 
>> Thank you. My time is expired I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields gentleman from Illinois. Mr. Casten is now recognized for five minutes. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, thank you all for being here. I'm. I have to preface this by saying that the questions I'm going to ask are completely bizarre, because it never would have. In different times. Um, I want to preface that by saying that I think the single best way, and I presume you'd all agree, the single best way that we ensure robust financial system is to ensure a robust us economy, um, rising tide tends to lift all boats. And number 

[3:49:34 PM]

two, everything that we all learned of substance in our freshman macroeconomics class is now deeply partizan. I learned that an independent fed was a good idea. I learned that, uh, that the 1890s and having, you know, a financial panic every decade was bad. And the United States policies that led to that were bad. But to acknowledge that now is to is to be partizan in this town. And I and I say all that because I would like you to answer this as if it was a year ago. Um, because I think my freshman macroeconomics book is still right. Um, as a friend of mine who describes herself as an anarcho libertarian recently told me, um, this moment is proving that the economists are always right. That's funny and not funny. Um, Mr. Carney, I want to start with you. Um, specifically, given the aba's role in our mortgage markets, the fed, of course, there's all this pressure for the fed to cut rates, but the fed, of course, only cuts the, you know, the overnight borrowing rate and the you know, I think the general consensus and I guess 

[3:50:35 PM]

I'd ask you, if you agree that 30 year mortgages tend to index more off the ten year treasury than the overnight rate. Would you agree with that? 
>> I think that's generally correct. 
>> Okay. I mean, I think fanny has made that point as well. So what is your sense then, of why it is that over the last several months we've seen a steepening yield curve? Put put another way, a growing spread between the fed funds rate and the ten year treasury, um, the ten year treasury hasn't really budged much, even through the rate cuts over the last several months. So what is your sense of why why that yield curve is steepening right now? 
>> Um, not in a position to actually answer that. I can ask some of our economists to try and find out more information on why that spread is occurring. Uh, there could be a variety of factors related to increased credit risk or things along. 
>> Those lines. Well, I mean, you know, JP Morgan, one of your members has said that the they've ascribed it to concerns over tariff uncertainty, higher near-term inflation and fiscal deficits. Um, might console the 

[3:51:35 PM]

Twitter writer has described this as the moron premium. Um, you know, because if you have a risk about the long term stability, you tend not to assume that current things are going to work through. And so in that in that vein, we've now got these attacks on the Independence of the fed, attacks on Lisa cook, um, citadel CEO, a pretty partizan guy, I would add, um, recently wrote an op Ed saying that these actions risk stoking high inflation and higher long term rates. We've got attacks on, you know, I guess if you don't like the data now, you just fire the head of the data agency. So we fired the head of bls because bls gave numbers that that, uh, certain man-child didn't like. Doctor Michelle, um, in a recent new York Times article talking about that firing, you said, quote, we'll just start seeing things get chipped away and eventually it kind of blows up. Would you agree that when the government manipulates data, um, as we saw when Argentina distorted their inflation rate, when we saw that when Greece 

[3:52:35 PM]

manipulated deficit, that that tends not to end well. 
>> Yeah, I would agree with that. That's not a good a good spot to be in. I hope that that does not happen. 
>> Did you ever think we would be at a point where we would be comparing us macroeconomic policy to Argentina and Greece? 
>> Not not not in this way, no. 
>> Um, so it just strikes me that we're sitting in this moment where we're talking about bank stability. We all want bank stability, right? Why would the fed lower rates right now inflation is close to 3%. It's not at their 2% target. The way to lower inflation would be to cut tariffs. But that would of course to be acknowledged that 1890s monetary policy was stupid. And we're not going to do that. So maybe we're going to lower rates because unemployment's going to go so high. And I guess the all of these employment data is pointing that direction. But stagflation is a terrible idea for all of us. And if, if, if we cannot on a bipartisan basis, acknowledge that my freshman macroeconomics 

[3:53:36 PM]

textbook is still right. Then we're going to make all of your banks, all of your clients in a much, much less stable than they are. And I just hope we can we can start acting like adults again pretty soon, and not just on this side of the aisle, I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields gentleman from South Carolina. Mr. Timmons is now recognized. 
>> Thank you for that, Mr. Chairman. I guess I'll start by saying I wish my colleagues across the aisle hadn't spent $7 trillion in their four years to get us into the situation with high, high, high interest rates and high inflation. Now, on to the actual subject at hand. Uh, when congress passed S 2155, we recognized that small community banks, particularly those in rural areas, were being overburdened by capital requirements that were originally designed for the largest and most complex institutions. That's why we created the community bank leverage ratio. The Keebler was intended to provide a simpler, more appropriate capital framework for low risk community banks. It was supposed to reduce compliance 

[3:54:38 PM]

costs and give small institutions a clearer path to demonstrate capital adequacy, allowing them to focus more on serving their customers and less on navigating complex regulatory frameworks. However, the results so far suggest that the framework is not functioning as intended. Today, only about 41% of eligible community banks have chosen to opt in. That tells us there's a disconnect between the policy goal and the practical outcome. For small banks operating with limited staff and tight margins. Unnecessarily high capital requirements mean fewer loans to small businesses and fewer resources for their communities. Uh, Mr. James, what are some of the reasons that only about 41% of community banks have opted into the Keebler? 
>> Uh, congressman, I think, uh, some of the reasons are some of the things that you stated in your question. I mean, I think, um, you know, our institution as well as the national bankers association are in support of the community bank capital flexibility and growth act of 2025, which would adjust down slightly. Uh, those, uh, that 

[3:55:40 PM]

community bank leverage ratio in order to allow us to deploy more resources for staff, uh, as well as systems that will help us to be more efficient in serving the community. Um, so I can't speak for all the institutions that did not opt into the community bank leverage ratio we have. We tend to be very conservative about how we manage our capital. Uh, but it would allow us a little bit more flexibility if we could move that, that number down slightly so that we can. Geology resources to better serve the communities across the state of Georgia and Alabama. 
>> Thank you for that follow up to that, Mr. Carney, what are some potential changes that could make the Keebler a more practical and attractive option for these institutions? 
>> So just to pick up where Mr. James, uh, started, uh, when we've talked to institutions about, um, opting into the community bank leverage ratio, one of the things that we've heard is that banks like to hold buffers above any regulatory minimum. And so a 

[3:56:40 PM]

bank opting into 9% might only be comfortable doing that if they're at 11, 12, 13%. Um, and so oftentimes, you know, we've been very disappointed that only 1600 of the roughly 4000 institutions eligible have opted in. Um, we are supportive of lowering the community bank leverage ratio. And also we are supportive of, um, increasing the threshold in which banks may opt in. That is another $10 billion mark. Uh, chair Barr mentioned Durbin amendment, a number of other things that tied in at 10 billion. This is another one. And this is another threshold that can be indexed. 
>> Thank you for that. I would also like to highlight the critical role that community banks and credit unions play in the rural areas of my district. Many of these institutions have served local families and small businesses for generations. Their success is not built on sophisticated technology, but on deep relationships and trust within the community. Yet I consistently hear from these institutions that the rising cost of compliance and the duration of regulatory examinations are placing significant strain on already 

[3:57:41 PM]

limited resources and personnel. One particular area of concern is the treatment of brokered deposits. For many community banks, brokered deposits are a critical tool for managing liquidity in a safe and sound manner. However, inconsistent definitions and overly broad restrictions have created significant regulatory uncertainty even in cases where there is little to no elevated risk. Mr. Wiley, can you discuss some of the ways community banks use brokered deposits to access funding that allows them to make more loans to small businesses and families? 
>> I'm sorry, I'm struggling to hear you a little bit. Um, more ways that banks can access funding. Is that what you said? 
>> Um, can you discuss some of the ways community banks use brokered deposits to access funding that allows them to make more loans to small businesses and families? 
>> Well, I do I do think they need them. I do think that, uh, the rules need to be relaxed a little bit, and they need to be customized for the bank and they need to be used. Judgment needs to be used by the local 

[3:58:42 PM]

regulators. 
>> Thank you for that. It is essential that our framework reflect the realities community banks face, and that it supports their continued role in strengthening local economies. With that, Mr. Chairman, I'm out of time and I yield back. 
>> The gentleman yields back his five seconds. The gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Lynch, is now recognized. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And ranking. 
>> Member foster. 
>> Um. 
>> And I want to thank the witnesses. 
>> You've been very. 
>> Helpful today in the wake of the collapse. Some of this is going to follow up on Mr. Huizenga's line of questioning earlier. But in the wake of the collapse of first republic, silicon valley bank and signature bank in 2023, at the time, those were the second, third and fourth largest bank failures in us history. Uh consumer and advocacy organizations such as better markets and Americans for financial reform raised some serious concerns about. Bidding for the assets of those failed 

[3:59:45 PM]

banks. Now, while federal law prohibits large banks with more than 10% of total us deposits from acquiring another bank, that nationwide depository cap does not apply, as you know, uh, to the acquisitions of failing banks. And, uh, as you also know, the fdic is is currently required to resolve a failed bank by selecting the bid that would present the least cost to the deposit insurance fund. In the case of first republic, JPMorgan chase, the largest us bank with more than well, now it's got more than $4 trillion in assets entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with the fdic to assume more than $100 billion in deposits and $230 billion in assets, and a deal that included an fdic loss share agreement that greatly reduced the risk and cost of that acquisition by requiring the fdic deposit insurance fund to absorb the majority of losses 

[4:00:45 PM]

that may have resulted from certain first republic loan portfolios. While a number of healthy banks also bid to acquire first republic, JPMorgan officials stated that their winning bid was predicated on the bank's financial strength and business model that facilitated a minimal cost transaction, again to Mr. Huizenga's point. JPMorgan then promptly announced plans to shut down one quarter of first republic's 84 branches, uh, which they viewed as duplicative or redundant to their own operation and their existing network at the expense of depositors who were left with no local branch. And then we had about a thousand employees who were laid off. So, Mr. James, as we seek to promote health in the banking sector, can you offer us your perspective on why it might be important to ensure that smaller qualifying institutions, community banks, regional banks, uh, might have a fair shot when it comes to bidding on the 

[4:01:46 PM]

assets of those failing banks. 
>> Thank you. Congressman, the, uh, diversity of our financial institutions is extremely important to the functioning of our economy. Uh, I think one of my, one of my colleagues stated earlier that the American financial system is the best in the world because of its diversity, because of the different types of institutions. And so we would support, uh, maintaining that diversity, particularly when it comes to resolution, ensuring that smaller institutions have fair opportunities to acquire and resolve failed institutions is critical to those depositors and the communities that they that that those institutions were serving. 
>> That's great. Thank you. So I'll soon be I'll be introducing my legislation, the failing bank acquisition fairness act, to enhance fairness in this bidding process and recognize the critical role that smaller financial institutions, either community banks or regional banks, serve to provide tailored banking services to their communities and advance financial inclusion. 

[4:02:47 PM]

Specifically, my bill would restrict larger financial institutions that hold more than 10% of total us deposits from acquiring failed bank assets, where community banks or other smaller institutions have also submitted a qualifying bill. So I am grateful to my friend. Uh French hill. Jim and hill and chairman Barr for attaching a discussion draft of this legislation to be discussed today. Um, to any of the other witnesses, have any any thoughts on that? I mean, it seems to make sense that if we want to increase competition and and also we want to provide provide those services to a wide, wider community. Um, and it's it's better to let let as many banks bid as possible and have the opportunity to be successful. 
>> So, um, aba is supportive of expanding, uh, the least cost test and what, uh, what bids are considered, um, things we've considered thought about is, uh, community bank consortium bids. Uh, the fdic 

[4:03:47 PM]

generally also has a preference for whole bank resolutions, which automatically excludes smaller institutions because it's very difficult for small bank to put a bid on a larger institution. However, you could bid on parts of it. And so we do think these are issues worth exploring. 
>> Okay. That's great, Mr. Chairman. My time is expired and I yield back. Madam chair. Sorry. 
>> I now recognize the gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. Floyd, for five minutes. 
>> Thank you, madam chair. Um. 
>> Thank you all for being here. It seems to me the fundamental. 
>> Question that we. 
>> Have today. 
>> Is how should. We prioritize. 
>> Different policy goals as it relates to. 
>> The bank. 
>> Resolution process? 
>> Uh, one recent. 
>> Instance where. 
>> We saw some of these public. 
>> Policy goals collide in real time during a fast paced resolution process was during the collapse, as Mr. Lynch noted of first republic bank back in 2023 after being appointed receiver for first republic, the fdic entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with JPMorgan chase to assume all of first republic's deposits and most of 

[4:04:49 PM]

its assets. Now, because of this agreement, the regulators did not have to use the systemic risk exception for first republic. Instead, they found a transaction that would allow another bank to take on the uninsured deposits and thus save the diff from another costly hit. After the collapse of silicon valley bank and signature bank in March of the same year. If your objective is to minimize losses to the diff, this move made sense. And to be clear with a statutory least cost resolution for the fdic of minimizing cost to the diff you know is their primary objective. The question here is whether we, as policymakers, should adjust the priorities of our regulators in these situations going forward. Uh, while I understand that the merits of the least cost resolution, I understand that if we end up with resolutions that lead to a us bank crossing the 10% of total us deposits threshold, particularly since there were 

[4:05:50 PM]

reports of other bids on first republic, then perhaps we need to think more about which factors were optimizing to. So my first one is for Mr. Burris. Do you feel that the least cost resolution mandate should remain unchanged? And if not, what do you think the other factors we need to consider are in the process? 
>> Thank you for the question, congressman. Um, no, I do not think the least cost resolution provisions should remain unchanged. I do think that careful analysis is required to understand cost right there. We've talked a little bit here today about restricting competition. There's cost associated with that, although that's not viewed as part of the equation currently. Um, timing is also another factor. But I do think that, um, some of the policy suggestions that you've made are very helpful and enabling other institutions 

[4:06:51 PM]

to participate or even have a successful bid, uh, if it's a reasonable bid over a north of 10%, uh, bidder, um, is helpful to competition in the system and should be implemented. 
>> Thank you, doctor Michelle, how do you think we should think about these conflicting priorities in this area? If we're weighing the public policy objective of minimizing the cost of the diff against the public policy objective of preventing further market concentration of the banking market, what's the right way to think about this effective balance between these two competing priorities, given that, in my opinion, when you exceed 10% of all us deposits, um, that can be very dangerous. And to have that kind of market concentration. 
>> Well, I mean, you you can't have everything, so to speak. Right? So, I mean, if you're going to have the fdic run this and you're going to have exclusively ftc deposit insurance, and you're exclusively going to have to 

[4:07:53 PM]

protect it, uh, then you're you've opened the door and you've created the reason to have all of these rules and regulations, you know, and and yet yet you still have a fair amount of discretion. And there's reason, good reason to believe, or at least reason to believe, uh, that the, the, the primary reason non bankers were held out of that resolution process was simply a bias against non-banks by the the chairman at the time. So I, I mean, I think you could, you could pick any one area that you want to sort of focus in on and restrict more. But you're like eventually you're going to have to pick something, right? 
>> Yeah. Understood. I you know, in my opinion, if we tweak how the fdic handles the the resolution process, I wouldn't want to inject lots of subjectivity and complexity to it. To your point, I know that the American bankers association has supported some policy change around resolutions, and my time is 

[4:08:54 PM]

running out. I think it's important, though, that we pay attention, as members of congress, to the market concentration issue as banks get bigger. I come from a state that prides itself on community banks, and sometimes I wonder, will we be able to preserve this very main street level of, of banking opportunity for, for people in my state. So thank you. And I yield back. 
>> Thank you. I now recognize the gentleman from Ohio, miss beatty, for five minutes. 
>> Thank you. Thank you, madam chair and ranking member. And thank you to the witnesses for being here. Uh, madam chair, let the record show that I had a series of questions on cdd fees. But in light of the conversation and so many of those questions being addressed, I'd just like to enter into the record that I support those words, and especially those of ranking member Maxine waters. 
>> Sure. Without objection. 
>> And also, in that same light, 

[4:09:55 PM]

uh, would like to express that the March executive order by president trump that directed the funds to be reduced or eliminated is not something I support, nor that in may of this year, when the white house put out their budget documents that included a proposal to wind down ccdf funds, that I am also in opposition with that. Now, with that said, uh, I will move on to the reciprocal deposit bill and say thank you. First to Mr. James for, uh, your comments and support of that. And I'd also like the record to know that I have colleagues on both sides of the aisle and three members on the other side who are co-sponsors of that bill. And, uh, Andy Barr mentioned it today prior to his leaving. Uh, Mr. James, I'm going to start with you. And before I go to my question, let me just say thank you. I've had some time, um, and had been in Savannah, Georgia, and have 

[4:10:56 PM]

some mutual banking friends who had just praised the work that you and your family, um, that you have done and that you continue to do there in your financial institution. And thank you for identifying, working with cdfi's or mdis only 2021 in the country now of mdis and you use the terminology financial freedom. And thank you for that, because I think that puts into perspective what we do here. When we talk about the economy and we talk about finance, that one of the things in banking is to make sure that we have financial freedom for individuals. But I'll go on to my bill with congressman emmer and myself. As you know, this bill updates the reciprocal deposit caps to allow for greater flexibility for community banks to receive non-brokered treatment of reciprocal deposits. Can you, 

[4:11:57 PM]

um, have some dialog with us on what types of depositories use reciprocal deposits and are they business folks? Are they individuals not for profits, etc. 
>> Uh, congresswoman, first of all, thank you very much for the bill. Uh, and thank you for, uh, continuing to have a bipartisan support for expanding opportunities for small community institutions like ours to access deposits that we can insource back into our community. Um, our institution, uh, is survived for 98 years. Uh, we'll be celebrating our 98th birthday, uh, in February of 2026. And the reason we've been able to do that is because we've been able to invite a diversity of institutions to support us. Uh, so the types of institutions that support our institution, which, again, is headquartered in a census tract that has almost 70% poverty, um, our individuals, corporations, nonprofits, municipalities and larger financial institutions, 

[4:12:58 PM]

it's really critical for us to be able to deliver services and have impact in our community to deliver on our mission, which is to provide the building blocks to financial freedom, uh, to be able to bring capital from other places. Uh, so, folks, uh, in corporations or larger institutions or nonprofits that are interested in the impacts that we have in community and are willing to make large deposits with us, have allowed us to actually almost double the size of our institution. Uh, on the heels of the historic investment in the cdfi fund that has trickled down into our institutions. And so being able to access that liquidity from larger organizations is really amped up. Our ability to invest in small businesses and homeownership. 
>> And time's going to run out. Uh, but I did want to go to Mr. Carney and asked him, uh, how important are reciprocal deposits, in your opinion? 
>> Uh, reciprocal deposits are important. And expanding their 

[4:13:58 PM]

access, uh, without any sort of negative interference from regulators is very important. Uh, the legislation you mentioned would be a positive step forward. Uh, again, we think that the bigger issue is relates to broker deposits and the need to repeal section 29 of the fda. 
>> Okay. Thank you. And hopefully we can continue this this dialog I yield back. 
>> Thank you. And I now recognize myself for five minutes of questioning. And I would thank all of our witnesses for joining us today in California, where I'm from, community banks have relied upon the community bank leverage ratio to lower their regulatory burden and instead invest that money saved in the communities around them. However, if we could lower the community bank leverage ratio by an additional percentage point or more, we could see even more community banks uplift their surrounding communities. And crs estimated in 2020 that lowering the 

[4:15:01 PM]

community bank leverage ratio from 9% to 8% would result in an additional 550 banks being eligible for a simple capital ratio and lower regulatory burden. So in California, an additional eight banks would have been able to receive regulatory relief and spend more time focused on their community and customers. That is why I'm introducing the community bank lift act, which would review the components of the leverage ratio and allow regulators to lower the community bank leverage ratio and make needed reforms to the ratio. So combined, my bill will help uplift community banks and allow them to better serve the communities. So now let's talk about the community banks that have opted into the community bank leverage ratio framework. And can you tell me, Mr. Carney, let me start with you. What benefits, um, would 

[4:16:03 PM]

they experience compared to the traditional capital requirements. 
>> So the community bank leverage ratio allows, uh, banks to, if they opt in, to just do a simple leverage ratio requirement rather than the complex risk based regime. Um, there's significant compliance costs related to the risk based regime. And so the first immediate savings would be taking that compliance cost and being able to deploy it in the communities that they serve. Um, by lowering to 8% or lower, uh, you would also lower the minimum capital requirement, uh, that they are using. And that would free up resources. Uh, one thing I just want to note is that even banks that many banks that are eligible have not opted into the framework, uh, even though they have exceed the capital levels. And in part, that's because they want to maintain buffers above any minimum threshold. Um, as a result, you mentioned 500 banks. I would expect if you dropped it to eight 8%, you would actually have more than 500 

[4:17:03 PM]

banks opting in. 
>> Um. 
>> So I was talking about how it would affect my district too. But, uh, as you can see, there are some tangible impacts that this will bring on our communities. Absolutely, yes. So can you also talk about how, with that additional flexibility, allow community banks to support small businesses through more robust lending? 
>> Oh, sure. Absolutely. Uh, capital generally is viewed as the most expensive form of funding. It's a buffer. It's the first exposure to take a loss at a bank, and therefore investors demand a higher, uh, higher rate. Uh, those higher amounts would be passed through to customers if you have higher capital requirements. And so by lowering the community bank leverage ratio, in effect, you're making products and services for bank customers, um, cheaper and more available. 
>> Thank you. So in 2023, when silicon valley bank collapsed, many of my constituents feared that this would be the first of many California banks to collapse. But thankfully, that 

[4:18:05 PM]

didn't happen. And, uh, but we have been proactive now to ensure that we learn from that crisis. So one thing that we have identified through that subsequent hearings is that there is a stigma associated with the discount window. Uh, let me ask this question to Mr. Reilly. Do you have any recommendations on how we can address the stigma surrounding the discount window? 
>> The stigma around what, again. 
>> The stigma around, um. 
>> Oh, the discount. 
>> Discount, yeah. 
>> I'm sorry. Yes. Um, well, there shouldn't be one, that's for sure. And maybe that's, uh, communication and and promotion from the regulators or anything. Uh, I don't I don't think there should be a stigma with that at all, but, uh, you gotta assume that there will be some banks that don't go to the discount window and say, you know, try to use that against their competition. I will tell you, in dealing with trust preferred 

[4:19:05 PM]

and, and treasury lending and things like that in the past, if you know from zero eight that stigma was not real big. 
>> Let me ask a question to Mr. Bracey. What role do you think confidentiality protections could play in removing the stigma surrounding the discount window, since you seem to know more about it? 
>> Uh, do I think there should be some confidentiality? 
>> I'm talking to Mr. Burris. 
>> Oh. I'm sorry. 
>> Yeah. Um, I do think the confidentiality requirements, if expanded, would help remove stigma. Um, I know lots of banks that are very worried about accessing the discount window. Uh, some who do periodically to test and very intentionally do it in very small denominations. So it's clear that when publication occurs, they don't need it. So, uh, anything that could make the the tap more confidential would help, as would requiring banks to do it more consistently. 
>> Thank you. My time is up. Um, let me now recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, for five minutes. 
>> Thank you, madam chair. I 

[4:20:07 PM]

thank the ranking member for her comments and would associate myself with the comments of the ranking member. I would call to our attention the intelligence that has been provided to me, indicating that there are 4487 fdic insured institutions. And it is my belief that less than 50 are black owned. In fact, less than 40 are black owned. To be more accurate, less than 30 are black owned. To be even more accurate, less than 1% of black owned. I'm interested in knowing how we can use this topic of, uh, funding access to acquire more black banks. Uh, I been with friends who've 

[4:21:10 PM]

started banks. It is not easy to acquire tier one capital. Tier one capital is not a black bank in the country with $10 billion in tier one capital, probably two exceed 1 billion, probably two now. Mr. James, you're much more, uh, educated on these things than I. So correct me, do we have more than two black banks with with tier one capital exceeding $1 billion? 
>> Uh, thank you for the question, congressman green. Um, actually, uh, there are 25 black owned institutions in the United States. Uh, and there are two that exceed 1 billion in total assets. Uh, so, uh, technically, no, there are no institutions that are black owned that have more than $1 billion in tier one capital. These are institutions that are, uh, just over $1 billion in 

[4:22:10 PM]

total assets. 
>> And the truth is this we we didn't get here because black people are not intelligent, because they can't count, because they can't be educated. It's racism. So the question becomes, how do we overcome this racism so that black people can own banks and acquire capital? I don't have the answer, but I know what has created the problem. And until we confront this, I'm not sure that we'll be able to resolve the issues associated with starting and maintaining black banks. If. Mr. James, do you have any answer for me to help me understand how we can acquire more black banks and and deal with the racism that still exists? 
>> Uh, thanks again. Um, I do want to acknowledge that, uh, in the last five years, uh, for 

[4:23:11 PM]

the first time in American history, we have seen a convulsion in the United States economy, such as what happened during the pandemic and actually not seeing a decline in African American owned institutions. Uh, typically, you know, when you have the great depression or the great recession, you would lose typically around half of the black owned institutions would fail because they were undercapitalized. In the last 5 or 6 years, there's been more capital available. And so we've actually seen a slight uptick. So at the beginning of the pandemic, there were only 19 black owned banks, and now there's 25. And so that's good news. Uh, I think it would be, uh, very helpful, uh, to again, you know, reduce that that community bank leverage ratio to a smaller, uh, to a smaller number, uh, to increase the access, uh, for our reciprocal deposits and other forms of liquidity so that you could have smaller institutions of all types, uh, whether they serve urban and rural communities, whether they be 

[4:24:13 PM]

black owned or owned by anyone else, uh, where you can encourage, just encourage more competition and more different types of institutions. Regulatory reform is also important because if we can evolve regulatory, uh, regulation, regulation. 
>> I'm going to. 
>> Have to we can have more institutions. 
>> I'll have to intercede because I have to close with this two things. The first is I, I think that we can do things to help all banks, but at some point we will have to do something to help black people. We really will. We didn't get here because we were unable to help ourselves. It was because others wouldn't allow us to help ourselves. And the final thing is, are there no women who can can do what you men do? Uh, I always pay attention to who's on these panels. All male panel. But for this African American, I assume you're African American. You look like one to me. I don't know, but, uh, you know, but but for the Democrats, we wouldn't have a 

[4:25:14 PM]

have a African-American on the panel. 
>> Gentleman. Gentleman's time. 
>> Gentleman's time has expired. I yield back. 
>> Gentleman yields back. I now recognize the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Mercer. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
>> Thank you. To our witnesses. 
>> Uh, for the last. 
>> Couple hours, 2.5 hours of testimony. 
>> Uh. Important information. 
>> Being, uh, provided. 
>> Thank you. 
>> So in 2018. 
>> Congress passed this 21, 25. 
>> Or. 
>> 55 to tailor regulations for banks on asset side size, providing relief. 
>> To community banks. 
>> The trump administration. 
>> Now is continuing. 
>> This push. Moving away. 
>> From a one size fits all regulatory approach. While the Biden administration really was. 
>> Pushing the opposite. 
>> Way, recently fed vice chair. 
>> Of supervision bowman. 
>> Proposed changes to community bank leverage ratio, a framework that allows community banks to meet a single simple capital standard of 9%, as you well. 
>> Know. 
>> And we've been discussing important changes to reciprocal deposits like those proposed in emmer's bill, which I 

[4:26:15 PM]

co-sponsor could provide a stable source of funding for smaller banks, especially those that rely on reciprocal deposits to give their customers extra protection. So, Mr. James, I'd like to start with you, uh, community banks, uh, follow a complex rules that assign different capital requirements depending on the type of asset they hold. Uh, the community bank leverage ratio takes a simpler approach. Banks just need to hold capital equal to. 
>> At. 
>> Least 9% of their total assets. 
>> Uh. 
>> Why is this a. 
>> Simpler standard? Why is this simpler standard more effective? Do you believe in it? And how would lowering that threshold? As vice chair Bauman suggested, help banks like yours? 
>> Um, thank you very much for your question. Uh, I want to echo the comments of my colleague, Mr. Carney. Uh, just simplicity and flexibility. I mean, if, you know, for a small institution like ours that, uh, has a very limited staff and limited resources, uh, complying with complex rules, uh, just takes resources away that we could otherwise deploy 

[4:27:17 PM]

in communities. And so by having that community bank leverage ratio, that simplifies, uh, one of the many myriad of regulatory requirements. And so if you want to encourage more institutions and more competition and more access to capital, uh, particularly within regulated financial institutions, so that you're not just having a proliferation of non-regulated banks and financial institutions, then, uh, reducing that that community bank leverage ratio is a good idea because it will, you know, bring more people back into a regulated financial system that would, you know, not expose folks to as much risk. 
>> Very well said. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Uh. 
>> Mr. Carney. 
>> Similar question. 
>> What do you see as the. 
>> Biggest advantage. 
>> Of having capital requirements designed specifically with community banks in mind? 
>> So the community bank leverage ratio is specifically designed for community banks. It does provide the relief, uh, that we've been discussing. Um, we would like to see that relief expanded. Uh, we would 

[4:28:18 PM]

like to see, uh, the community bank leverage ratio level drop to 8% at most regulators can do that. Uh, currently, uh, with it's within their purview with us now, but congress can actually drop it lower than that amount. Also, uh, by doing so, you will have more banks opt in. Uh, banks have typically tried to hold buffers above regulatory thresholds. Uh, so if it's 9% now, they'd only be comfortable opting in if they're at 11, 12, 13%. And so by lowering that ratio, I think you would have community banks would have a lot more resources to deploy, um, into their communities. And compliance costs would be, uh, cut. 
>> All right. Important comments. 
>> Thanks. 
>> On a scale. 
>> Of 1 to 10, how hard is it for community bank to comply with the current complex rules compared to the straightforward kebler? 
>> Uh, so the community bank leverage ratio is almost automatic. Uh, it's a leverage ratio within the call report. So compared to anything else, it is uh, it is a lot easier. 
>> Great. 
>> Um, Mr. Wiley, uh, 

[4:29:19 PM]

reciprocal deposits are a way for banks to give customers more fdic insurance coverage than the usual 250 K limit for the benefit of people back home. Can you explain in simple terms why banks engage in them? 
>> Why do banks typically use reciprocal deposits? Yes, one to access funding because they need it and they're growing to, uh, customers that they have. They want to reduce the risk and try to get under the $250,000. 
>> See any harm in it? Do you see any harm in it? 
>> Pardon me? 
>> Do you find any harm in it? 
>> Do I find harm in it? Right? No. 
>> Okay, good. That's what I wanted to ask. All right, uh, Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time. 
>> Gentleman yields back. I now recognize myself for five minutes. Uh, thank you, gentlemen, for being here this afternoon. Um, I'm also a member of the judiciary committee. Uh, chairing the 

[4:30:21 PM]

antitrust. Um, so my first question kind of goes to. It's a bigger question, but, uh, I believe my opinion, the biden-harris administration took kind of a negative posture towards, uh, mergers and acquisitions across the board, uh, resulting in applications being substantially they were either delayed or there was very little transparency. Uh, and us bank mergers faced kind of a unique multi-agency review requirement, uh, involving both antitrust and prudential regulators. Uh, in in my opinion, again caused delays and uncertainty is varying from, uh, whatever sector you were referring to. Uh, healthy mergers can increase obviously competition and make the banking system more dynamic, allowing banking organizations to realize the economies of scale and scope via mergers or acquisitions creates competition and generates cost savings that can be passed on. Uh, I understand that there's there's issues with with the 

[4:31:22 PM]

size of some of these institutions, but I just felt there was kind of a negative, uh, approach to this. So. Mr. Berry, um, it's kind of self-serving, but I have a bill, the bank competition modernization act, which, um, which is notice to this hearing, including the provision directing regulators to find that mergers resulting in a bank with less than 10 billion in assets do not create a monopoly or substantially lessen competition. So, given your experience, I know you've kind of addressed, uh, some of this stuff directly and on the on the fringe here this afternoon, but, um, can I just ask you, what is your opinion on this? And given your experience advising banks, uh, specifically finance firms and fintechs, uh, how do you advise them to approach this moving forward? 
>> I think your proposal is would be very helpful. And if I can, I'm going to try to tie 

[4:32:23 PM]

together a few things we've talked about. Um, it's incredibly difficult for small banks to compete in the united States of America. If you look at ratios of returns on assets, returns on equity multiples, uh, in the market, um, stock price, in other words, um, there's a direct correlation between size or scale on the one hand and positivity on the other. Good returns. Um, small banks face a huge uphill battle and, uh, allowing them to combine in a way that is efficient and fast and does not cause them operational difficulty while they are waiting, uh, for extensive periods of time to obtain approval is very helpful. Um, banks are subject to tons of competition from credit unions and financial technology companies. It's you're hard pressed to say that you can't find access to to to financial services in the United States, 

[4:33:23 PM]

except in some rural areas where it can be hard to get physical presence. So I think what you suggest is a good idea. And I think it would help not only with the approval process, but with a host of things that we've discussed as to why it's tough to be a small bank. 
>> So, Mr. Carney, let me, uh, let me just ask you quickly, uh, the competition modernization act is designed to ensure regulators fully account for all types of competitors, including credit unions, the farm credit institutions and non-bank financial companies. Um, how would you include these additional entities in a competitive factor when you're trying to analyze this, given the regulators a more complete picture of the full market? 
>> The merger rules are over 30 years old now. Um, goes back to 1995. Banking and financial services has fundamentally changed. And so taking into account competition, wherever and however that competition occurs is important. Focusing in on local bank branches is no 

[4:34:25 PM]

longer appropriate. 
>> Very good. Uh, I'll just finish. Mr. James, can you talk a little bit about when you're involved in a merger and you find yourself having to continue to market your services and you're courting maybe a 90 day holding pattern? 
>> Uh, thank you for the question. Yes. I think, you know, quicker resolution of merger and acquisition activity would always be helpful, uh, so that you can, you know, stop focusing on, you know, compliance and regulation and more focused on and get get more focused on customers. You know, we've seen instances where, you know, customers, you know, get concerned about the debit card number changing and, you know, core conversions. And those are real operational issues that we would rather focus on rather than, you know, complying with regulation or responding to, you know, inquiries from, uh, supervisors. 
>> Very good. Thank you so much. 

[4:35:26 PM]

I'd like to thank all the witnesses. Thank you, gentlemen, for being here this afternoon. And without objection, all members will have five legislative days to submit additional written questions for the witnesses to the chair. The questions will be forwarded to the witnesses for the response. Witnesses, please respond no later than October 14th of 2025. This hearing is adjourned.

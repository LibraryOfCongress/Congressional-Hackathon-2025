in health care and financial services will come to order. Welcome, everyone. Without objection, I may declare a recess at any time. I don't expect to. Uh, I recognize myself for the purpose of making an opening statement. Welcome to the subcommittee on health care and financial services and other stuff. Today, we will tackle an important topic the health and well-being of America's school children. The current state of America's children's health is not great. And for years it's been going in the wrong direction. More than 1 in 5 Americans over six years old are obese. A 270% increase since the 1970s. So when I am asked to speak to a classroom of little children, I can't help but noticing that they are clearly much heavier than the children were in the 

[2:29:42 PM]

1970s. American children are diagnosed with prediabetes at a rate double the rate of 20 years ago. Two decades ago, rates of depression have nearly doubled since 2007. I think if we ask the children when I was in middle school or when I was certainly in elementary school, what depression was, they never would have heard the word. Approximately 3 million high school students reported suicidal thoughts in the last year. A study shows that youth in the us are being prescribed psychotropic drugs at a rate significantly higher than our European countries, and I don't know where the numbers are around the number of kids getting psychotropic drugs in the 60s or 70s when I was a child, but back then I would never known it was even one of my classmates. 15% of American boys and 8% of American girls 

[2:30:42 PM]

have been diagnosed with hyper with attention deficit hyperactivity activity, hyper attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, and prescribed a daily stimulant or prescribed daily stimulant pills as a treatment. Something else that I didn't know was even going on when I was a child, probably because it wasn't going on almost at all. We are literally giving millions of our children amphetamines and other potent stimulants. Meanwhile, the modern American childhood bears little resemblance to the childhoods we herself experienced just a few decades ago. According to the American academy of child and adolescent psychiatry, American children spent an average of 7.5 hours per day looking at screens. No wonder they. Well, we're coming up to the next bullet point. Numerous studies have found a link between increased screen 

[2:31:44 PM]

time and anxiety, depression, obesity, sleep problems, and more. 27% of our youth between the ages of 17 and 24. 77% of our youth between the ages 17 through to 24 would not qualify for military service without a waiver due to obesity or other health conditions. Isn't that just shocking? We're going to read that again. 77% of our youth between the ages of 17 and 27 would not qualify for military service without a waiver due to obesity or other health conditions. Isn't that scary? Scary. Children enrolled in medicaid or their state's children's health insurance program are more likely to be diagnosed with a behavioral health disorder. These are often children from single parent households due to the 

[2:32:45 PM]

lower income qualifications for medicaid. The number of child psychiatrists in the us has grown over 37% in the last seven years. My question is, did it help? Our children are struggling with their mental and physical health, all the while being over medicalized by a health care system that does not hesitate to prescribe more pills, that it help. On top of that, too many children are not eating the nutrient dense foods they need for healthy growth and development. Uh, foods that provide important nutrients to the diet, such as fruits and vegetables, dairy, whole and enriched grains should be encouraged. Instead, children are increasingly being fed ultra processed foods such as soda, candy, and chips. The makers of which lavish campaign contributions on politicians. This, in part, is contributing to the childhood obesity 

[2:33:47 PM]

epidemic, impacting an estimated 14 million children in the us. The most recent CDC study on weight gain trends over time found that the average weight in Americans has increased 24 pounds since 1960. Uh, I noticed that when I speak in my local schools, I don't say it, you know. Do your kids look fat? I don't say it, but I think it. Uh, so I'm glad the trump administration, through HHS secretary Robert F Kennedy and usda secretary Brooke Rollins, are working hard to bring attention to and solve this crisis. On may 22nd of this year, the make America healthy again commission released a 78 page report which covered many of these topics. Well, this report has been needlessly politicized and demonized by some Democrat politicians. I'm sure not my 

[2:34:48 PM]

ranking member. Um, and mainstream media pundits, I suspect many have not read it. I want to read a small snippet, and I quote. The purpose of this report is radical transparency about our current state. To spur a conversation about how we can build a world together, where one American farmers are put at the center of how we talk about health and to America. The American health care system thrives when disease is prevented and reversed, not just managed in a sick care system. End quote. Sounds like common sense to me. That will greatly improve the health and happiness for our young children. I'm glad secretary Kennedy is a disruptive force. Our constituents know that something is deeply wrong with the status quo when it comes to health. Last November. Well, we won't partizan. We'll make this partizan. But you know, 

[2:35:49 PM]

president trump, uh, we believe was given a mandate to improve the health of American children. And people want to change, man. Um, congressman, enact policies which make America healthy again. We'd love to have the children as healthy as they were in the 80s, the 70s, the 60s. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle can, on the other side of the aisle, can agree that what is happening to our nation's children is alarming. Our children's health is not and should not be partizan. Both sides must stand up to the health problems we have in this country and stand up to the processed food industry and make people healthier. No matter your party, you should be. It should be clear that many American children are suffering. Something needs to be done to address the health 

[2:36:50 PM]

of our youth. Today we will hear directly from two federal experts who are actively working on addressing multifold threats to our to our nation's children. We thank you for being here today. Oh wow. They look so healthy. We got the right people. We thank them for appearing at today's subcommittee hearing, and look forward to a productive discussion on this important topic. I yield to ranking member Christopher Moore for his opening opening statement on this topic. Thank you. Do you remember when they were all healthier when you were a child? 
>> Yes, sir. Thank you. And I agree with you that we have challenges right now. Um, mister chair, thank you for convening this hearing. Every day I come to work, I think about what I can do in congress to ensure that children in this country will have a better future than the generations before them. I'm not sure that 

[2:37:50 PM]

all the leaders of this administration have exactly the same mindset. HHS and the usda have actively contributed, unfortunately, to a worsening health crisis for children in at least two ways. First, by slashing critical programs like snap and medicaid, and second, by undermining public trust in vaccines and medical research that are proven to help keep children healthy. First, president trump's one big beautiful bill act will take away snap benefits from countless children, including in families with those over the age of 14. As a child, my family utilized snap's predecessor, food stamps. When my own father lost his income in the early 1970s. Snap, which is the successor program, helped us, uh, to to get on our feet and afford healthy and fresh food. It is cruel to take 

[2:38:51 PM]

away this social safety net from families just to give the wealthiest a tax break. On top of this, 15 million Americans will lose their health coverage and be left uninsured due to devastating cuts to medicaid. These medicaid cuts are projected to close at least 11 rural and inner city hospitals in my home state of Illinois, making it harder for kids to get the healthcare they need. Health systems that are able to unable to continue operating will be forced to lay off staff and cut services. Because of these budget shortfalls. Families will lose access to doctors, medications and preventive care. The next generation, namely our children, will unfortunately suffer the consequences. Additionally, secretary Kennedy and others at HHS have been unrelenting in eroding public trust in vaccines that save children's lives. Rfk has made outrageous claims, literally saying that 

[2:39:52 PM]

vaccinating our children is, quote, a holocaust. What this is doing to our country, these outrageously wrong claims are driving states like Florida to remove critical vaccination mandates, even for school children. Even president trump says the following about vaccines. They're, quote, pure and simple. They work. They're not controversial at all. And I think those vaccines should be used. That's what president trump said. I may never, never say this again, but rfk should listen to his president. Protecting kids health is not new to me. It's been at the heart of my work since I came to congress. I helped build big tobacco accountable when they began targeting our children with flavored vapes. I began an investigation and helped later introduce legislation to keep toxic heavy metals out of baby food. And I devoted myself to increasing access to mental health services for students, 

[2:40:55 PM]

no matter where they live. By introducing the connecting students to mental health services act, any child can see the plain, simple truth here. This administration's policies are harming our health and jeopardizing our future. If we as a country truly care about making America's children healthy again, the first step is holding HHS and usda accountable for the roles they're currently playing and worsening our children's health today. Thank you. And I yield back. 
>> Thank you. You kind of are in the ballpark, but not okay. Without objection. Representatives subramaniam and Crockett are waved onto the committee for the purpose of questioning witnesses at today's hearing. Okay, now, I'm pleased to welcome. So pleased 

[2:41:56 PM]

to welcome our witnesses for today. Doctor Dorothy fink and doctor eve, study. Doctor fink is the acting assistant secretary for health and the head of us public service commission course at the us department of health and human services. Doctor study is the director of the nutrition guidance and analysis division of the us department of agriculture. We look forward to hearing what you have to say. I really look forward to it. Pursuant to committee rule nine and the witnesses will please stand and raise their right hand pursuant to was that again pursuant to committee rule nine, the witnesses will please stand and raise their right hand. Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony that you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but 

[2:42:57 PM]

the truth, so help you god? Let the witness let the record show the witnesses answered in the affirmative. Thank you. May you you may take your seat. We appreciate you being here today. I really appreciate you being here today and look forward to your testimony. Let me remind the witnesses that we have read your your statement, and it will appear in full in the committee record. So please, I'm a flexible guy, but please, as you know. Right. Flexible. Yeah. I mean, witnesses say my counterparts and flexible. Let me remind witnesses. We do. We've read your statement. Please try to limit the statement to five minutes. As a reminder, please press the button on the microphone in front of you so that when it's on, members can hear you. When you begin to speak, the light in front of you will turn green. After four minutes, the light will turn yellow. When the red light comes on. Time to wrap it up. Now, I don't know how we 

[2:43:59 PM]

decided this. We flipped a coin. Uh, doctor fink, we're going to let you go first. Isn't she look great? 
>> Thank you. Chairman Grossman, ranking member krishnamoorthi, and all the members of this committee for inviting me today to speak on a matter of national importance in our country, focusing on the rising epidemic of chronic disease in our nation's youth. First, I'd love to tell you a little bit more about myself. I'm triple board certified in internal medicine, pediatrics, and endocrinology. Prior to joining HHS, I practiced as an endocrinologist, treating patients with many of the chronic diseases that we will be discussing today. Since joining HHS, I have led the office on women's health, and currently I am leading the office of the assistant secretary for health as the acting ash. Addressing chronic disease in children, including obesity, hypertension, diabetes, 

[2:45:02 PM]

autoimmune conditions, mental health conditions, and cancer is a signature priority of president trump's administration and secretary Kennedy's us department of health and human services. For too long, the public health and medical establishments have described conditions such as type two diabetes, hypertension and obesity as Progressive, incurable and lifelong conditions. Americans are bombarded with advertisements suggesting that medications and alone can manage these conditions. Missing from this narrative, and central to secretary Kennedy's vision, is the recognition that many of these conditions are preventable and potentially reversible. Chronic diseases take a heavy toll on children, families and our economy. But the American people should know that there is hope. We can change the trajectory of these conditions through evidence based prevention, nutrition, 

[2:46:02 PM]

physical activity, and lifestyle interventions. In my clinical experience as an endocrinologist, I have helped patients who believe their diseases were irreversible, regain their health and vitality through such interventions to change the trajectory of chronic disease. HHS is putting greater attention on prevention and research into the root cause of disease, promoting lifelong health and nutrition begins at birth with a goal of exclusive breastfeeding for at least the first six months, with continued breastfeeding as long as the mother and baby desire until two years or beyond through operation stork speed. HHS is working to ensure that safe, nutritious and wholesome formula options are available to every mother, child and family. When supplemental or exclusive formula is necessary for the baby's growth or survival. As children grow, they are exposed to unprecedented levels of processed foods that are high 

[2:47:02 PM]

in sugar and chemical additives. The results are devastating. Approximately 32% of adolescents in the us have prediabetes, and furthermore, 36% of children and adolescents have excess weight. Furthermore, American girls are reaching puberty earlier and boys are experiencing declining testosterone levels and reduced sperm counts compared with previous generations. These trends may be linked to diet, obesity, and environmental exposures, and they demand immediate investigation. The long term health of future generations depends on our ability to confront these issues with urgency and evidence based solutions. The good news is that these outcomes are not inevitable. In fact, they are preventable. To counter these trends, HHS is prioritizing access to nutritious food in schools and communities. Updating the dietary guidelines for Americans to reflect gold 

[2:48:04 PM]

standard science and improving federal nutrition programs for low income families, in partnership with the department of agriculture, HHS is also investing in comprehensive nutrition education, ensuring that physicians and health professionals understand how food impacts health, while equipping families with practical tools for healthy eating. HHS is also restoring physical activity as a central part of childhood development by reestablishing the presidential fitness test and working with schools and families to integrate daily exercise, we are giving children the tools to build strength, endurance, and lifelong habits of movement. These strategies, taken together, may offer an alternative to medications for many children. Beyond diet and lifestyle, we face new and pressing concerns. The mental health crisis among adolescents has led to increasing use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or ssris. Despite the fda's 2004 black box warning noting an elevated risk 

[2:49:05 PM]

of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in young people. While these medications have benefits, they must be paired with careful monitoring and expanded access to nonpharmacologic interventions and adolescents that address the underlying causes of depression and anxiety. Today, we stand at a crossroads. The chronic disease epidemic in our children is the defining public health crisis of our time. By focusing on safe, wholesome food, clean water and environment, nutrition, education and physical activity, we can reverse disease, reduce dependency on medication, and restore hope to millions of families. Under the leadership of president trump and secretary Kennedy, HHS is committed to making America healthy again. With your help and collaboration, we ensure that America, America's children, are not burdened with lifelong illness, but instead thrive as the healthiest generation in our nation's history. 
>> Thank you. I was a little bit flexible there, as 

[2:50:07 PM]

advertised. Okay. Uh. Doctor? Study. Fire away. 
>> Thank you. Chairman, ranking member, and members of the subcommittee for the opportunity to appear before you today. I'm doctor eve. I'm the director of the nutrition guidance and analysis division at the center for nutrition policy and promotion within the food and nutrition service at usda. I have served at usda for over 15 years, and have supported the development of the dietary guidelines for Americans since the 2010 edition. As has been mentioned, a healthy diet is made up of nutrient dense whole foods, including a variety of protein foods, dairy, vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Substantial research has shown that when children and adolescents consume a dietary pattern that emphasizes these food groups, they have healthier growth and development, and that it sets the stage for better health and disease prevention across the lifespan. Unfortunately, the state of the American diet is poor. This poor diet has 

[2:51:08 PM]

resulted in worsening health outcomes among children and adolescents, which have contributed to increased rates of chronic disease. The healthy eating index, or hdi, is an analytic tool that has been developed by usda and that measures the quality of the overall diet. High scores can range from 0 to 100, with a score of 100 indicating alignment with the healthy diet. The average high score for children and adolescents 2 to 18 years of age is a 54 out of 100. Among the top sources of calories in the American diet are desserts and sweet snacks. Sugar sweetened beverages and chips and savory snacks. These foods illustrate that the American diet is high in added sugars and refined grains. Regarding added sugars, Americans consume about 270 calories, and that comes to about 17 teaspoons of added sugars a day, and intakes can vary substantially. For example, adolescent males consume a 

[2:52:09 PM]

range of about 100 to 725 calories from added sugars per day for refined grains. Intakes are also high, with average intakes ranging from 4 to 7 ounce equivalents per day from foods like desserts, muffins, and chips. Collectively, many of these foods can be described as highly processed or ultra processed foods. A recent report has found that 61.9% of calories consumed by the youth were categorized as ultra processed, while intakes of refined grains, added sugars, and highly processed foods are high intakes of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and dairy are low. As examples, only 1 to 2% of adolescents meet daily recommendations for vegetables or for whole grains. In fact, on any given day, excuse me, about half of our youth do not consume a vegetable or a fruit intakes of protein. Food varies. Of note, 78% of adolescent 

[2:53:09 PM]

females do not consume enough protein foods like meat, seafood, beans, and nuts. The displacement of nutritious foods by non-nutritive foods has contributed to the current chronic disease crisis. The prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents is 36%, or about 1 in 3. Additionally, about one third of adolescents have prediabetes. These health concerns have immediate impacts and contribute to an increased rate of developing chronic disease later in life. Usda is committed to working collaboratively to fulfill president trump's mandate to make America healthy again. Recently, usda and HHS partnered to request data and information that will be used to help develop a uniform definition for ultra processed foods. A uniform definition would allow for consistency in research and policy to pave the way for addressing health concerns associated with the consumption of these foods. We encourage anyone with an 

[2:54:09 PM]

interest in this issue to submit comments by September 23rd at regulations.gov. Usda has also already started to take action to ensure healthy families and communities, for example by issuing state waivers to restrict the purchase of non nutritious items like soda and candy from the supplemental nutrition assistance program or snap, and by purchasing millions of dollars in fresh seafood, fruits and vegetables from American farmers and producers to to distribute to nutrition assistance programs across the country. Usda and HHS are also working together to develop the next edition of the dietary guidelines based on sound science. Usda looks forward to continuing to work together with our federal, state, and community partners on identifying innovative solutions to support healthy choices, healthy outcomes, and healthy families. Thank you and I look forward to our conversation today. 

[2:55:09 PM]

>> Okay. Uh, I guess I'm going to start off by giving myself five minutes. Uh, first of all, doctor fink, you heard my opening statement in which we talked about the huge number of people who are not eligible for military service. Right. Did you hear that? 
>> Yes. 
>> You want to comment on that and how things have changed since I was a child? 
>> Sure. Thank you for the question, congressman. It is horrifying to see and hear the statistics that you shared in that doctor study. And I shared, um, during our opening statements. When we discuss that 36% of children and adolescents in America have excess weight. It is a tragedy. 
>> How is that compared to 50 years ago, you know. 
>> Yes, compared to the 1970s, 

[2:56:10 PM]

obesity rates have soared. Um, when we look at obesity, it's at least four times higher compared to the 1970s. And then rates of severe obesity have gone up even higher than that. It is. 
>> It's one of the reasons why we can't get these people in the military. 
>> Exactly. And we need to find solutions. And that is exactly what we were doing at HHS, under secretary Kennedy's leadership, to really focusing on taking our health care system from a sick care system to a health care system where we can address chronic diseases and work to give patients hope, to not just talk about chronic diseases. As these lifelong Progressive conditions that they require many medications to treat, but instead conditions that we can work far, much farther upstream through physical activity and healthy nutrition. 
>> Okay. Um. Is the problem a 

[2:57:13 PM]

lack of food? I mean, um, I talk to my own doctor or a doctor who, um, they assigned to me or whatever here. He laughed so hard I thought he was going to cry, uh, that president Biden had said that we need, uh, greater caloric intake. And then we we've had. Do you think the problem is the lack of calories here? 
>> The the it is multifactorial. Most definitely. And so food plays a huge role in our health. And that is why we are currently working on the dietary guidelines and ensuring that they are based on gold standard scientific evidence, so that every American family across America knows the best foods. And furthermore, they can take steps to reverse their chronic diseases. 
>> Well, as both of you, the question we'll start with doctor Stewart because we want to get her in the mix. Um, doing part of this, do you 

[2:58:14 PM]

think we should continue to, through the snap program? Um, up the number of sugar drinks or processed foods that are. Poorer citizens are are right now consuming? 
>> As I mentioned in my opening remarks, um, secretary Rollins has encouraged states to submit waivers to, um, restrict the purchase of non-nutritive items, including sodas, candy, um. Some states have chosen other options to date, uh, the secretary has signed 12 waivers to the restrict those purchases, and we look forward to continuing conversations with additional states. That does include states such as Texas, Louisiana, and Florida who I know are represented here. And the intent of those waivers is really to increase the purchase of more nutritious items. So allowing those funds to be used 

[2:59:14 PM]

to purchase whole, nutritious and healthy foods. And secretary Rollins and secretary Kennedy have been very active in supporting um states in pursuing those waivers. 
>> We have, uh, seen a dramatic we're going in reverse here as far as, you know, kids, obesity, kids, um, prediabetes. I mean, it's scary that over time we are going in reverse here. Do you think this ought to be a federal mandate? We ought to change the federal rules and prevent these kids from eating junk food. I mean, it's going to take a lot of guts to stand up to the, um, to the processed food industry. Like I said, I'm sure they're very politically active, but do you think, uh, federal government should step in and say, no, we're not we're not going to buy any more pop tarts. We're not going to buy any more Mon do. 
>> I'll say at usda, we really feel like agriculture and America's farmers, ranchers and producers are at the core of the solution. So really supporting, um, getting whole, 

[3:00:14 PM]

nutritious, healthy foods to kids. I think the how we get to the next phase is similar to what doctor fink said, just as we got here. There's a lot of multifactorial considerations, I think to move to really change the landscape is going to involve a lot of people. It's going to involve industry. It needs to involve schools, restaurants. It needs to involve a variety of different players to have a meaningful impact. And I think the federal government is part. 
>> Of that. Doctor fink, do you think you said that your doctor's study, you said the federal government is part of the solution? Is that what you just said? Yeah. Doctor fink, do you feel it's part of the federal government's part of the solution? And, uh, changing around what we eat here, insofar as we're paying for so much of the food that our kids eat? 
>> Absolutely. And empowering families, children to fully understand, you know, when we talk about a third of of adolescents with prediabetes, they can reverse that, and they can reverse that through eating better, whole, nutritious foods. 

[3:01:16 PM]

>> So the politicians. 
>> Stand up to the junk food lobby and say, enough of this. The children come first. 
>> Absolutely. But then also empowering the doctor patient relationship and really working, as we are doing through education with nutrition and health care professionals. It's going to help that as well. 
>> Okay. Well, I guess I'm I've been generous enough to myself. Um, my, uh, ranking member here, would you like to comment on on this or ask a question? We give you five minutes to ask questions and we're being flexible. I told you, I'm flexible. 
>> Yeah. Okay, good. Okay. Okay. Hey. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate doctor fink. Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell were found guilty of running a child sex trafficking ring where they abused at least 1000 young girls over decades. In a Fox News interview with Jesse Watters, rfk admitted to flying on Epstein's plane, the Lolita express, at least twice. Doctor fink, you've never, never been 

[3:02:16 PM]

on Epstein's plane. I take it right. 
>> Thank you for the question, congressman. No, I have not, and I appreciate the question. I would really love to talk about chronic disease today. 
>> We're going to get to that here. The flight logs showing the exact flights that rfk was on with Jeffrey Epstein. Now rfk is also excusing his friendship with Epstein in the following clip. 
>> Sorry about that. 
>> Can you turn up the audio? 
>> Sorry, guys. 
>> Okay, I'll read the clip here. He said the following in his in his podcast. I ran into everybody in New York. I knew Harvey Weinstein. I knew Roger Ailes. O.J. Simpson came to my house, Bill Cosby came to my 

[3:03:16 PM]

house. Doctor fink, you've never socialized with Harvey Weinstein or Roger Ailes, I take it. 
>> No, I have not. 
>> You never had Bill Cosby or oj Simpson to your home, right? 
>> No, I have not. 
>> In that same podcast, rfk described Ghislaine Maxwell saying, quote, she was always wonderful to me and, you know, kind. You wouldn't call her kind, would you? 
>> Representative I respect these questions, but I really don't think that this is the time to go into this. We have a chronic disease crisis in our country. 
>> You wouldn't call Ghislaine Maxwell kind, would you? Who ran a child sex trafficking ring that abused more than a thousand girls? 
>> No, I would not. And I also would say that we have a chronic disease crisis in our country right now, and we need to address it. 
>> We have a crisis. We're going to get to that. The fact that rfk hosted and socialized with murderers, sex traffickers and serial rapists is deeply 

[3:04:18 PM]

disturbing. That's why I'm going to seek to have this committee interview secretary Kennedy under oath about his relationships with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Let me turn to my next topic the 988 suicide hotline. Doctor fink, you're the acting associate. I'm sorry, acting assistant secretary of HHS, right? 
>> Yes, I am. 
>> And samhsa and the CDC are components of HHS, correct? 
>> Yes, they are agencies within HHS. 
>> This September is, uh, has been deemed and recognized by samhsa as suicide prevention month. The CDC, for three different years under president trump, namely 2017, 2018 and 2020, concluded that lgbtq youth are about four times more likely to attempt suicide than their peers. You don't dispute those stats, right? 
>> No, I do not. There are also many other stats that we could 

[3:05:20 PM]

discuss here today to address chronic disease. 
>> Samhsa reported that in June 2025, nearly 70,000 calls were answered by this lgbtq youth hotline, doubling the number of calls that had been received just two years earlier. You don't dispute those stats, right? 
>> With all due respect, representative, I do not oversee samhsa and so I am not able to comment on the number of calls. 
>> Do you dispute that, though? Do you dispute what samhsa just put out this? 
>> I'm not disputing it, but I'm just okay. 
>> That's what I want to ask you. Okay. You despite this rising demand, when I led a bipartisan letter strongly supporting this hotline, HHS responded that it had ended the specialized hotline, ending the specialized hotline based on anti dei efforts. You don't dispute that, right? This is your agency, ma'am. We're talking about children. We on 

[3:06:21 PM]

the verge of committing suicide. 
>> We are here to talk about the metabolic chronic disease epidemic. 
>> No, we're here to talk about children as well and their health. And, ma'am, let's just be clear. At a time when lgbtq youth and children are reaching out for help like never before, this administration is shutting the door. This hearing is about meals and pills, but it should also be, Mr. Chairman, about fewer suicides among our children. Let me turn to my next topic. And this is about healthy food. Doctor study usda dietary guidelines recommend Americans at every stage of life should eat, quote, nutrient dense foods. That includes, I take it, eating your veggies right doctor study. 
>> Yes. 
>> Seemingly at odds with that mission. Axios reports that president trump's economic policies, namely tariffs, have 

[3:07:24 PM]

caused wholesale vegetable prices to go up by 40% in just one month. And I just went and bought some today with my staff, this these peppers and this broccoli at the wholesale level are are skyrocketing in prices. Doctor study. You don't dispute that. Axios reported a 40% increase in wholesale prices for vegetables, right? 
>> I'm not aware of their reporting. 
>> You don't dispute their statistics, right? 
>> I don't have specifics on, uh, specifics on prices. I'm here to discuss in my capacity as an expert on childhood nutrition. But we do have an entire, uh, agency, the economic research service, who I'm sure could provide more information. 
>> I'm just saying you don't dispute the statistics. 
>> I have no awareness of this. This? 
>> That's better. You don't have an awareness of. 
>> Statistics. 
>> Doctor fink, in your testimony, you wrote that HHS priority is to, quote, improve 

[3:08:24 PM]

federal nutrition programs for low income families. But healthy foods are costing more for everybody at this point. And according to cbo, this administration is going to cut snap benefits such that at least 300,000 families living with children 14 and older will lose food assistance. You don't dispute that, right, doctor fink? 
>> Representative, we, as doctor study shared, we between HHS and the usda are collaborating to take snap to the next level. Our goal is to ensure that children have access to wholesome, nutritious food. 
>> And they're losing access, ma'am. They're losing access because your administration is cutting all cutting snap benefits. 
>> With all due respect, sir, we are challenging states, as doctor study said, to submit waivers so that we do not poison our children with junk food and sugar. 
>> This is not junk food. This is going up 40% in cost. And 

[3:09:26 PM]

you're cutting the supports to buy this stuff. 
>> Through the snap program, we are offering waivers to states so that they can provide children with wholesome, nutritious foods. And we are really emphasizing that we cannot continue to provide soda and junk food and call that a quote unquote nutrition program. 
>> Okay. 
>> Thank you much, Mr. Sessions. 
>> Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. And I want to thank the administration officials who've taken time to be here and are here for the purpose that we are talking about. And that is food security, food safety, and the opportunity for us to make sure that federal funds are used on foods that do not encourage further diminishment of a person's life. Uh, I am interested in see that I think it's doctor. Study your, uh. 

[3:10:28 PM]

Presentation before us. We talked about ultra processed foods, and then you didn't struggle. You just said we're looking for a better definition. What are some examples of ultra processed foods? Where are these found? Uh, is it something that a family does? Is it taught? Uh, in schools? What is ultra processed food? 
>> Ultra processed foods is really a topic that's grown in discussions, I would say in the last decade, um, there's been a lot of research. One of the prime definitions that has been used in research is one that came from Brazil, and it's called nova. Um, the way that foods are categorized within that system and similar systems is the level of processing that they undergo, whether they have additives, uh, flavorings, things like that, colorings, um, as well as there are 

[3:11:29 PM]

considerations around, uh, added sugars, added fats, salt. So there are a number of definitions, um, some that are primary. You know, nova noted was the primary one. Um, but some have uh, there has been discussion that some of these definitions are really broad and that they're including things like, I think a lot of us, when we think of ultra processed foods, things like sodas or candy are really a friend of mine, and they're pretty generally agreed upon as ultra processed foods. But there are some things, like whole grain products like yogurt, like bag salads or canned vegetables that there's questions like, should those be included in that larger definition of ultra processed foods? So what we are doing in partnership, usda and HHS in partnership, is going into that process and trying to understand when we're talking about ultra processed foods, what are we talking about? Um, there's some things that really cast a broad net. And is that 

[3:12:30 PM]

the net or is there kind of a subset of that? And those questions are things that we're trying to answer in that conversation. 
>> Thank you. The things that are necessary for women who may be pregnant or children that are born before, I guess there will say the age of 10 or 12, are those generally things that the the department and certainly under the wick program and certainly maybe a grocery stores are there guidelines? Are there things that encourage women who in particular pay attention to children, their nutritional needs balance? How do how do people generally understand what would be in a child's best interest? What would be in a mother's best interest? Do you do advertising? Is it at the grocery store? Is it at the pediatrician? We I've seen things throughout my life and 

[3:13:31 PM]

my children where when you go, you learn about the importance of a child seat and a car. You get healthy reminders. You do things I'm around, things I've never seen, really. Advertisement or information for children to get the caloric intake. That would be important. How do you get this information out? 
>> I think it's probably all of the above of what you just said. Um, we do have nutrition recommendations for those populations within the dietary guidelines. The 2020 edition was the first that provided comprehensive guidance from birth in to older adult through older adulthood. So we have that guidance in the dietary guidelines for Americans. And as we've both noted, that work to update the dietary guidelines is underway. Um, we communicate that through various channels. Uh, doctor fink is from the office of women's health. So there's work 

[3:14:33 PM]

that communicating healthy nutrition there. Uh, we have tools within usda as well, which has a lot of educational components. I do think, though, you make a very good point, that there should be even more. And I think one of the really important parts about this conversation in Maha is that it is increasing awareness. It is increasing those conversation that childhood nutrition does matter. I think there has been a notion that their kids, they'll kind of grow out of it. I don't really need to think about my diet or my physical activity or other aspects until I'm older, until I have a health concern. And I think this conversation has been really important in saying it does matter. It matters for kids. And so I'm hopeful that these conversations continue. I do think, though, that it does require more education campaign campaigns. So that is something that we hope to see as a part of this continuous work on promoting healthy eating within the departments. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to take just an 

[3:15:34 PM]

additional few seconds. I intend to use this opportunity to highlight to me, and I'm going to begin putting together something that when we talk people or send things out or do town hall meetings, I'm going to include these things. We've talked about diabetes, but sometimes what I'm interested in is, you know, two bananas equal, healthy or whatever it might be. And, Mr. Chairman, I would hope that the members of this committee would take back something that they can highlight to their constituents and others. I want to thank you for holding this hearing today and for the, uh, for the expertise that we have here today. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
>> Thank you. I'll have to send something out on my email list telling people we got to do better. Um, miss Randall. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you to our witnesses. 
>> For being here today. You know, for some kids, school is the only place that they can get a nutritious meal. Um, and 

[3:16:36 PM]

in 2023, the usda found that 7.2 million children were at risk of not getting enough food to meet their nutrition needs. And not everyone may believe that it's enough food or enough calories. But there are plenty of kids in this country who are not getting enough food and the right kind of calories. And for those children, programs like snap and tefap, the emergency food assistance program, which supports, among other things, the ability for food banks and schools to buy fresh produce from local farmers and school lunch and breakfast programs. Their lifeline, their meaningful nutrition for kids so they don't fall asleep in class so that they can learn so that they can grow and be healthy. And as the usda's food and nutrition services notes on its own website, there are clear associations between food insecurity and poor health, links to chronic disease and 

[3:17:38 PM]

diabetes and cancer. Doctor study what does usda's research say about the impact of poor nutrition on children's health and well-being? 
>> As noted, poor nutrition has immediate impacts on health. Um, we have evidence around performance in school, but now more, as we both noted in our remarks, it's extremely concerning that we have such a high prevalence of overweight and obesity, as well as something that's been more recently, um, seen in the literature is that these various factors, poor diet being one of them, low physical activity and other factors have resulted in about 1 in 3 adolescents having prediabetes. Um, that statistic I think is extremely alarming. So yes, we definitely see that link. 
>> Thank you. And what are the long term effects of physical health, cognitive development and academic performance of 

[3:18:39 PM]

poor nutrition. So you mentioned immediately immediate results. But long term what do we see from these kids who don't have healthy food to eat. 
>> It sets the stage for poor health throughout the lifespan. So it's immediate impacts but also impacts later in life. 
>> Um, the snap cuts included in president trump's big ugly bill could result in as many as 9 billion fewer meals for families. For children. The snap cuts included, are making a huge impact on vulnerable populations, gutting food assistance. Based on what you've just shared with us, I think it's fair to say that H.R. One, the cuts in that bill will have a detrimental impact on children, not just right now in the immediate, but for years to come. Long term chronic health impacts that will plague our society. Doctor fink, since 

[3:19:40 PM]

the big ugly bill passed, committee members I've met with have warned that fewer Americans qualifying for snap and medicaid will lead to fewer schools offering universal free lunches in low income areas, reducing children's access to essential nutrition. As a pediatrician, is it important for children to have regular access to nutritious food? 
>> Thank you, congresswoman, for that question. As an endocrinologist and as a pediatrician, I can definitely say that having good, healthy nutrition is the cornerstone of developing the best health you have for your future. Thank you. And that is why. 
>> Thank you, doctor fink. Uh, so it's safe to say that losing access to consistent and nutritious, nutritious meals would be harmful to a child's health. Well. 
>> What I would like to say is we're actually looking to totally reform these programs because right now, the N in snap stands for nutrition. 
>> But. Doctor fink, what we're seeing is a cut of funding 

[3:20:42 PM]

available for nutritious meals for kids in schools, meals that are often the only available nutritious meal for children from some low income families. Do you see increased anxiety, depression, or behavioral issues in children struggling with hunger? 
>> Food most definitely impacts all aspects of health, and that is why, in collaboration with the usda and HHS, we are updating the dietary guidelines because as you can imagine, the dietary guidelines provide all of the information that then schools use to make these decisions for what goes into. 
>> Yes, thank you. But in the meantime, we're cutting significant funding to snap for actual food assistance to children and their families. Do you agree that losing access to consistent and nutritious meals due to cuts in programs like snap and tefap under the big ugly bill, will be harmful to a child's health? Well, like 

[3:21:44 PM]

recognizing that any of your work to plan and reevaluate is not immediate. But that's forward looking. So do you agree that losing access to consistent and nutritious meals would be harmful to a child's health? 
>> Right now we are working in the immediate in terms of getting access to better health for all of America's children and so, so. 
>> So if children, if a child, say, relies on, um, breakfast after the bell, they get their meals, healthy meals at school and they are not able to access those meals, they that child is hungry. Would you agree that that is detrimental to that child's health? 
>> We are ensuring that schools have the support they need so that they can give the best nutrition to all? 
>> Thank you for not answering my question, I yield back. 
>> Thank you. We're going to go to Mr. Maguire. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to the witnesses for being here today. This hearing 

[3:22:45 PM]

is truly bipartisan, as it is in everyone's interest to ensure American citizens, especially our children, are healthy. I have to commend the trump administration, uh, the commission and of course, the working people's tax cut, the the working families tax cut for making efforts to streamline and improve our programs that help kids. The commission report released some data about the health of American children. I would like to take the time to highlight some of the top line items from the report. And first of all, I would this this will tie into everything we're saying here is I think that we need to relook at healthcare not just for adults, but for children, that we should have a preventative health care system. And by bringing back the presidential test and things like that, I think it's preventative. Also, you cannot exercise your way out of bad nutrition, and we have to build a strong foundation at a young age. But we found out that more than 1 in 5 children over six years old is obese. In America, more than 1 in 4 teens have 

[3:23:46 PM]

prediabetes, which is preventable. Teenage depression rates nearly doubled from 2009 to 2019. 3 million high school students seriously considered suicide in 2023. You know, during the depression, when we had tough time in our country and in World War two when people were losing family members, depression rates weren't where they are today. Even though we're most educated today and we're wealthier today than ever, our children are not as healthy as they once were or should be. Doctor fink, in your opinion, does living in a sedentary lifestyle contribute to the likelihood of a child being included? In one of the previous statistics I mentioned? 
>> Yes. 
>> And doctor fink, how does a sedentary lifestyle impact mental health? 
>> There are so many factors, but when our children's youth are tied to a screen all day long and they're not being active, um, they build up of fat in their bodies, 

[3:24:48 PM]

right? You're not eating right. You're not active as body weight. Through excess body weight, you start making extra hormones and you have all sorts of metabolic impacts that impact every aspect of your body, including the developing brain. And so we most definitely want to make considerations for how we can get our kids active, which is, as you said, bringing back the presidential fitness test and just really challenging families to become active is the way we need to go. 
>> Well, I think you just said it, but president trump recently signed an executive order that reinstates the presidential fitness test, which was phased out by president Obama in 2013. Doctor fink, how do you believe the reinstatement of the presidential fitness test will benefit school aged children? 
>> Well, I'm speaking from someone who did the presidential fitness test as a child. It's really a fun experience to get together with your classmates and do those exercises and challenge yourself to get better each 

[3:25:48 PM]

year. 
>> Yeah, it's really an education on how to prepare and take care of your body and mind the rest of your life, and people that work out statistically are less likely to be depressed. Um, doctor, um, an estimated 70% of American diets come from ultra processed sources. Um, what problems can ultra processed foods cause for children who consume them on a regular basis? 
>> I think it's really around the over consumption of ultra processed foods. And there are there has been research that suggests and kind of tries to look at what are those mechanisms. There has been studies suggesting that overconsumption, consumption of ultra processed foods have been associated with higher body weight, increased risk of different um, risk factors associated with disease. There are a number of reasons why that may be. Is it because they're high in added sugars? Added or added fat? Um, added 

[3:26:48 PM]

sodium? Is it because they're low in fiber? Um, is it because it's they are displacing healthy foods in the diet? I think it's probably a many different things. Um, but we do see a relationship between overconsumption and risk, including in childhood. 
>> You know, lack of healthy food is a concern in my district, which is very rural. And I'd ask both of you, how how can HHS, how can usda work together to expand successful community based nutrition programs in my district, either one of you. 
>> Actually, I will take this opportunity to just mention that today. Um, secretary Rollins has announced, um, farm to school grants for fiscal year 2026. That are she they will be coming soon. So she's made that announcement. But we think that's a really important way to get locally raised, locally produced foods into child nutrition programs. 

[3:27:48 PM]

>> Thank you I yield back. 
>> Mr. Bell. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair and. 
>> Our witnesses for being here today. Um, speaking of preventative preventable, over the past seven months, we've witnessed a concerning and dramatic shift in public health policy under the leadership of rfk Jr at the department of health and human services. This overhaul has included the removal of CDC director, the vaccine advisory committee, and now the widespread promotion of misinformation. The consequences of these actions are real and alarming, and the health of the American people, especially our children, face significant risk. One of the most pressing threats is the growing anti-vaccine rhetoric that undermines decades of scientific consensus and life saving health policy. Vaccines have long been one of the most effective tools in preventing 

[3:28:49 PM]

disease. Currently, the CDC recommends over 15 childhood vaccines to protect against deadly illnesses. Some of the diseases these vaccines help prevent include influenza, measles, and polio, to name just a few. The CDC has found that from 1994 to 2023, routine childhood vaccine vaccinations in the us are estimated to have prevented over 508 million cases of illness and more than 1.1 million deaths before widespread vaccination efforts. Diseases like polio infected over 457,000 Americans, causing severe paralysis and life threatening effects. Today, polio remains a risk in only communities with low vaccination vaccination rates. Diseases like measles, which once caused over 880,000 deaths globally, have become increasingly rare. Research shows that with proper 

[3:29:50 PM]

vaccination, the measles the measles vaccine vaccine is up to 97% effective. Yet we are now seeing a resurgence. Over 1400 measles cases have been reported in the us this year across 42 jurisdictions. Under your watch, reports from the CDC and Johns Hopkins have shown a decline in vaccination rates from 2024 to 2025, a trend that if left that if left unaddressed, will have catastrophic consequences. We're not living in the early 20th century, and we cannot allow disinformation to drag us backwards. Vaccinations are not new, and the science supporting them is clear, consistent and decades strong. The current efforts under rfk Jr to attack the use of vaccines is irresponsible and endangers the public health of our most vulnerable populations. Public health should never be a political tool, especially when the facts are so clear. So, doctor fink, as a physician, 

[3:30:50 PM]

you do believe in science. I believe in scientifically backed medical medical practices such as vaccines. Correct. 
>> Thank you. Congressman, as a physician. 
>> That's a real simple question because I don't have a lot of time. You do believe in scientifically backed medical practices such as vaccines, correct? 
>> I need to clarify that because, of course, as a physician, I vaccinate my patients. 
>> Okay. And you believe in that? 
>> Absolutely. As a mother, I want to. 
>> So you agree that vaccines save lives, right. These are easy. These are softballs. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Okay. Well that's great. Um, doctor frank, and do you agree that when communities are ill informed that it makes them harder to make rational decisions regarding their health? 
>> Communities deserve to have the best gold standard, evidence based information and so that. 
>> They can have they don't get that information. It's harder to make a rational decision. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Okay. Um, after her firing, 

[3:31:51 PM]

doctor torres wrote in the wall Street journal, if we stay silent, preventable diseases will return. As we saw with the largest measles outbreak in more than 30 years, which tragically killed two children, I ask for unanimous consent to enter into the record. Doctor torres's full op-ed. 
>> Okay, so. 
>> So thank you, I yield back. 
>> Okay, Mr. Gill. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for for hosting this hearing. And it's, uh, good to know that we have an administration that is prioritizing, uh, making America healthy again. Um, in fighting for for children who want, uh, safe, healthy, uh, food and for Americans. And I think that that's refreshing. So we really appreciate this, um, doctor study. I've got a few questions, um, for you, first of all, what is health equity? 

[3:32:52 PM]

>> It's the consideration that all individuals have equal access to healthy foods or health. Different aspects of the health system. 
>> I think. I think all individuals should have, ideally have access to healthy food. Do you think that that should be the central lens through which we look at health? 
>> It is certainly an area of research and discussion. 
>> But the central lens, do you think that that that makes sense? 
>> I you're relating to, uh, the work of the 2025 dietary guidelines advisory committee that the previous administration did ask them to conduct their review of evidence with a health equity list. 
>> Are you familiar with this, uh, article? It entitled. It was from the American journal of clinical nutrition. It's called addressing misinformation about the dietary guidelines for Americans. Yes. Okay. And were you an author of this article? 
>> Yes. 
>> Okay, I thought so. Your 

[3:33:53 PM]

name's on the top. It's the second author. One of the statements in the says, quote, in addition, HHS and usda have prioritized health equity as the central lens through which all scientific questions will be considered in the 2025 dgac do you think that that makes sense? 
>> That was the request from the administration, and that was carried in through the charge to the committee. 
>> But do you think that this is a proper way to go about promoting nutrition? 
>> It is one of the discussion points that, I mean, it's one of the topics that is being discussed. 
>> Well, I'm asking if you think that this is a proper way of going about promoting nutrition in the United States. Your name is on this article. 
>> My perspective on that is I think it's good to look at evidence in all ways, and that can include through that perspective. 
>> Do you think it should be the central lens? 
>> I did not. That was the request from our administration 

[3:34:54 PM]

that. 
>> But you don't think that that's a you don't think that that's proper? 
>> I didn't write the specific charge to the committee. 
>> So your name is on the article. 
>> It's on the article is talking about what the request was to the 2025 committee. 
>> And I'm asking if you think that that is a proper lens to view nutrition through. 
>> I think it is a lens that you can view nutrition through. 
>> But is it a proper lens? Well, this is central lens. 
>> Again, as a career employee in the department of agriculture, I implement the request of our administration. And that was at the time with the Biden administration the request. 
>> Right. But we have a new administration with different priorities that don't include dei and health equity. Do you think that this is a proper way to view nutrition? 
>> I think it, as I've mentioned, that it is appropriate to look at literature in every. 
>> You're not you're not going to answer the question respectfully. Um, we can we can 

[3:35:55 PM]

move on. Then I would thought that that would be a simple one. Um, you're familiar with the scientific report of the 2025 dietary guidelines advisory committee, is that correct? 
>> Yes. 
>> And you're familiar with the members, uh, who who wrote that? Who were on the dietary guidelines advisory committee, right? 
>> Yes. 
>> Got it. Um, one of the things in this, in this same article, um, which you wrote as a, as a bit of you said misinformation, which you're attempting, uh, to dispel, um, is that there are no conflicts of interest. Is that correct? 
>> The discussion is that conflicts of interest is considered, was considered in the process to establish the dietary guidelines advisory committee. I think conflicts of interest, whether real or perceived, is an extremely important conversation. 
>> And one. 
>> Of the science. 
>> Right. One of the members of that committee is a man named Chris Gardner. He's a practicing vegan. He's a 

[3:36:56 PM]

environmentalist activist receives funding from a company called beyond meat, which is trying to, uh, run cattle producers out of business, wants to move towards plant based diets. Um, do you think that that's a conflict of interest that he is on this panel, um, advising the united States in an official capacity about what foods are nutritious and what aren't whenever he has a obvious financial interest in beyond meat. 
>> I'm not. I will say that conflicts of interest were reviewed by, um. 
>> I'm just asking if it is. A conflict of interest. 
>> Within the department of health and human services. Who chartered the committee, I, I think that those things should be disclosed and discussed. Um, and the department, the administration was aware of those, uh, affiliations. 
>> So that so you're that is a conflict of interest. Is that your testimony? 
>> I'm not an attorney in ethics. 
>> Neither am I. But it's pretty obvious, isn't it? 
>> Well, if you're talking about a financial conflicts of interest, that is something 

[3:37:57 PM]

that our ethics ethics attorneys review and assess. So I do not do that review of our members. Um, in that process we do have individuals who. 
>> So your testimony is that you don't know if this is a conflict of interest or not. 
>> Well, I will say I mean, there are processes and I think part of what. It's just a. 
>> Yes. 
>> Or no question with maja is should those processes be stronger? 
>> Right. It's just a straightforward yes or no question. Is this a conflict of interest or is it not? It could be somebody who is advising us on what is what is nutritious food, has a financial interest and a business that is trying to run cattle producers out of out of, out of work. 
>> I again, I will say that that is reviewed by our our legal counsel. 
>> Yield my time back. 
>> Looking at conflict of interest. 
>> Thank you, miss Simon. 
>> Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you, ranking member. Um, and I really appreciate this discussion for many reasons. And after hearing 

[3:38:59 PM]

parts of the discussion, you know, I believe many of us would contend that the greatest threat to public health in th United States today is not a virus. It is not a chronic disease. But in fact, the leadership of secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr. Under his watch, our federal health institutions are collapsing. He has forced out leading physicians and scientists with expertise on vaccines and infectious diseases. He has politicized the CDC and has undermined trust in science. At the very moment when families most need facts, not politics. Now, this is reckless and it is dangerous, and it is costing lives in real time. On September 3rd, 2025, more than 1000 current and former employees took the extraordinary step of demanding secretary Kennedy's resignation. 

[3:40:00 PM]

1000 Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to enter that letter into the record. Thank you sir. Secretary Kennedy should have never been confirmed. His leadership is a direct danger to the very health of every family in this nation. And I join in calling for his resignation. But families face an even more sinister threat in real time. That danger is hunger, and cuts to snap and medicaid will unleash what some have called the most considerable shock to public health in modern history. In California's 12th congressional district, my district, approximately 9000 adults could lose snap. Nationwide, nearly 40 million people rely on this program. Two thirds of them are children or seniors or people with disabilities. In my district, I met a mother of three who told me right now, 

[3:41:01 PM]

before the cuts actually take place, she says. I watered down my kids milk so that it lasts to the end of the month, she said. I go to school, I go to work. And still at the end of the month, my children go to bed hungry. Now that is not a policy or poverty by choice. That is a working parent doing everything right, holding down a job, raising kids, studying to build a better life, and still unafraid to keep going but unable to afford groceries. Families like hers are, in fact, feeling abandoned all over the country, left out into the cold and following every rule, but met with the reality that her government will continue to look the other way. These attacks are ripe. While grocery prices soar. If you've been in a grocery store anytime in the last week, you know you know. While the rent takes half of most poor families paychecks, 

[3:42:02 PM]

while corporations raise prices faster than wages, a mom working full time as a second grade teacher, or mom working retail or at a reception desk, or a student trying to hold down two jobs, trying to feed her children and paying the rent ended up at the end of the month. Far from in the black snap is the difference between food and hunger. Cut it and families will go hungry. We know what comes next. You mentioned it. We know what comes next. When children are hungry, children face worse health outcomes and those health outcomes live and linger with them throughout their lives. When they grow up in hunger, poverty reproduces itself. It becomes permanent, with empty stomachs and untreated illnesses. That is fact. So I ask and thank you, both of you for being here. Doctor study, is it not true that children deserve safe and 

[3:43:04 PM]

healthy meals every single day, including food that is grown locally? 
>> Yes. 
>> Thank you, I agree, I agree and again I thank you for being here. So then I would have to ask all of us, including our wonderful panelists here today, then why. And we talked about the new grant programs coming out and would love to hear more about those. So then why in March 2025, did usda cut more than $1 billion in plan funding for local school meals and food banks? Why did we cut local food for schools? Cooperation cooperative agreement program, and why did we cut local food purchase assistance programs? I would ask that you agree with me that children need more than slogans. They need food in their stomachs. I would love an answer from both of you if we have some time. And the 

[3:44:05 PM]

question was why do we cut those programs? 
>> Thank you for the question. I'll just note that, as mentioned, I'm here in my capacity related to an expert in childhood nutrition. I'm happy to take your question back, though, and we can get you a response related to that. 
>> I appreciate that. Thank you ma'am. And with that I would yield my time. But before yielding I would say, um, as someone who grew up was a young mom, I had wick and it's an amazing program. I was in college with my kid, and even with wick, even working half time in college full time with a baby on my hip, I still had to put food back at the checkout counter. It is expensive being poor. If we want to create a nation of healthy children, we would be expanding these programs. Instead of cutting them, we would be expanding school lunches instead of cutting them. We would ensure that every low income family in this nation had what they needed to make sure that their children went 

[3:45:07 PM]

to bed with full stomachs, and I yield back. Thank you. Chairman. 
>> Um, next. Um. 
>> First of all, I'd like to thank our, um, secretary Kennedy. Bring it back to him for standing up to the drug companies and standing up for the pharmaceuticals. This is what happens when you take on the special interest. But, uh, we next one up here, Mr. Summer Lee M subramaniam. 
>> Thank you. So let's be clear that dismantling of snap and medicaid is not making any kid healthier in this country. I mean, especially when you're also dismantling the very agencies that are tasked with child nutrition. Uh, we're talking about usda. We're talking about HHS, we're talking about firing experts at these agencies that have long, deep expertise in these fields. 

[3:46:09 PM]

And you know, what happens when you do cut snap. And medicaid is malnutrition, developmental issues, developmental delays, uh, long term chronic health issues. That's what happens instead. And I want to focus especially on on what's going on at the usda though, because, uh, in 2019, they tried to move two offices at the usda, uh, nifa and ers. And what ended up happening is that these agencies lost a ton of expertise. They lost half their staff, uh, a lot of their experts. And, uh, they ended up not having the ability to get out grants and loans that institutions needed to do their research. And now there's a proposal on the table to move all of usda away from this region. And that's going. Think of the impact that had on those two offices. Uh, multiply that by 100. Think about all the farmers that will suffer, all of the kids that will suffer, 

[3:47:09 PM]

all of the work that will suffer because of that, and at a huge expense to taxpayers. And so, uh, doctor study I is it true that employees at usda were asked were sent a survey, uh, on the potential move away from the region? 
>> There is a, um, open public comment period related to the, uh, reorganization, so I can speak to that. Um, but beyond that, I don't have any additional comments in my capacity. But again, we'd be happy to take that back and get any responses. 
>> For usda employees sent a survey about a potential move. 
>> We were encouraged. We have been encouraged to provide comments. 
>> Even you've been encouraged to provide comments. Yes. Okay. Because I was told by usda employee, uh, in your office that that they were actually asked about this move. And what was interesting was then they were asked to put their name on 

[3:48:10 PM]

their comments as well. Do you think if someone requested or said that they didn't like the move and put their name on it, that there would be any retaliation to that employee? 
>> Again, I'm here in my capacity as a nutrition, um, expert. I don't have specific. 
>> I got I'm not I'm not laying blame for what's going on on you. Uh, but I'm just saying generally that I have many usda employees in my district, and they are very concerned about this. Uh, and again, in 2019, when they moved those two offices, nifa ers, uh, those two offices, they do research mostly. Is that correct? Do you know the can you tell us they do economic research? Right. And so it was just economic research. But now you talk about usda also administers snap benefits, correct? 
>> Yes. 
>> What else does usda do for children? Uh, your office does nutrition guidance. Is that correct? 
>> Correct. 

[3:49:11 PM]

>> Great. And any other functions that usda that you think are worth mentioning here today. 
>> Related to child nutrition or child nutrition program that supports school meals, our special supplemental nutrition assistance program for women, infants and children. So, uh, which they're all within usda as well. 
>> So would you say your office does a lot of important work? This is the easiest question you'll get today. Yes. What if you lost half of your staff? Would you be able to do the same amount of work or quality of work? 
>> I can't speak to specifics across the agency. 
>> Very diplomatic answer. I think if I lost half of my staff, I would not be able to do the same quality of work. Uh, but I'll just end with a story from a constituent. She's actually a farmer, and she says that farming is already extremely challenging profession. And these changes that usda make it even harder for us to continue feeding hundreds of millions of people each year. Farmers need stable and reliable access to the 

[3:50:11 PM]

financial and technical resources required to farm this year's funding freezes, programmatic cancellations and staff downsizing at usda have already impacted my farming operation by canceling critical grants. The proposed quote unquote reorganization is not only unnecessary, it will only compound these problems for farmers all across the us. Sometimes our constituents say better than we can, and I'll say that I will continue to stand up and fight against this usda relocation, I yield back. 
>> Okay, miss Crockett. 
>> And Mr. Chair, before I begin, um, I do have two ukes that seemingly work really well right here. Um, one says farm bankruptcies in 2025 already exceed 2024 levels. That is from Hoosier ag. And the second one, um, says farm bankruptcies rising in 2025. Thank you. All right. Um, the reason that I wanted to talk about farming is because it seems like we think that we can talk about things 

[3:51:12 PM]

in some sort of, um, vacuum. You can't talk about healthy children if you don't talk about whether or not they have money to access any food, whether it's good or bad. Some would argue that if you don't have money to access food at all, whether it's good or bad, it's probably bad for the child to not have anything in their body. The reason that those on my side of the aisle keep bringing up these cuts is because we know that we already have a hunger problem in this country, considering the fact that we have a hunger problem in this country, it's now only been compounded by the poor policies of this administration and house Republicans as well as senate Republicans. You see, I don't believe that you can just have a mantra where you say, make America healthy again without actually doing the work, because as the good book says, faith without works is dead. So let's talk about the work that really needs to be done. Number one, it's policy. Policy that 

[3:52:14 PM]

doesn't look like ridiculous tariffs that unfortunately now have our farmers going under. In fact, to be very specific, farm bankruptcies are up 55% compared to 2023, which minimizes the amount of food that we do have that will be available. And ultimately that food will be more expensive because that simple economics, yet at the same time, the $6 a day that people get to eat, that's going away. And besides the snap benefits themselves, we're talking about those kids that only get their food at school, and we are able to set the guidelines for whether or not that's healthy food or not. The reality is that I am so disturbed because under this department of health and human services, literally, they have become the threat to the American people serving from the state of Texas. Unfortunately, we had to endure the very beginning of the measles outbreak for the first time in 20 years. Children are dying. That doesn't look like 

[3:53:15 PM]

making us healthier again. In fact, a lot of people want to talk about measles. But the plague is back now. We had our first contact of that that recently came out, and we know how the secretary feels about polio. Polio may end up coming back right now. President trump, secretary Kennedy and congressional Republicans are perpetuating the most significant public health attack on Americans ever. In just a few months, they have diminished ability to respond to outbreaks and emerging health threats. They've dismantled teams that ensure Americans are consuming safe foods. They've weaponized the federal government against universities performing world class research. They've implemented the most significant cuts to healthcare in American history. These people hate it when American families have access to healthcare. They hate it when American families have access to healthy foods. They hate it when American families have access to affordable housing. They hate it when American families have access to affordable child care. Because 

[3:54:16 PM]

these people simply hate America. Nearly everything they have done makes Americans less safe and less healthy. The consequences of their actions are simple more children will die and have more children will go hungry. More children will live in extreme poverty. More children living with disabilities will lose access to school based therapies and services. So, doctor fink, you're here to rubber stamp this agenda. An agenda that's so unpopular, the the Republicans are deciding to cheat in next year's elections. But nevertheless, let's talk about it. Doctor fink, in 2021, you provided a presentation at the university of north Texas health speakers bureau titled women's health. Do you remember that? Yes or no? 
>> Yes, I do. 
>> Well, during this presentation, you spoke at length about the importance of vaccines. In fact, one of your slides stated, quote, clusters of under or non immunization have the potential to foster transmission of vaccine preventable diseases, including 

[3:55:16 PM]

measles. Is this a slide from your presentation? Yes or no? 
>> I haven't reviewed that presentation recently. 
>> So so we're going to go you don't know you work under someone who has become the face of the anti-vax movement. So who's right you or the secretary. 
>> Thank you so much for that. 
>> You are the secretary. 
>> I would like to tell you that secretary. 
>> You are the secretary. 
>> Is challenging us to use gold standard. 
>> So you're going to filibuster. And I only have 25 seconds. So I'm going to go with you. Assume you, but you know that he's your boss. This administration has lost all credibility with the American people and our global partners. No one believes you care about improving health outcomes when you're slashing nih research into Alzheimer's disease, women's health, cancer, and diabetes. No one believes you care about public health when you cut programs that support maternal and child health and eliminate healthy start, no one believes you care about children. When you implement the largest cut to medicaid in history. Americans know the truth. And the truth is that 

[3:56:17 PM]

this administration, with the help of congressional Republicans, has unleashed the most significant assault on public health in American history. The people will die as a result. I yield back the remainder of my time. 
>> Okay. Pursuant to committee rule nine, C, the majority minority shall each have five additional minutes to question the witnesses. You might let you go first, Mr. Bell. 
>> That would be nice, Mr. Chair. Thank you. Um. Before I have to, um, you, uh. But first, a quick question. Uh, doctor study. Correct me if I'm wrong, but health equity. Equity actually talks about everybody, correct? 
>> Correct. 
>> And poor white kids would be included in equitable outcomes. Is that correct? 

[3:57:17 PM]

>> Correct. 
>> Poor black kids, poor hispanic kids, poor Asian kids would all be included in equitable outcomes when we're talking about health equity. Is that correct? 
>> Yes. 
>> I find it very interesting that my colleague insinuated, doctor fink, that your administration under rfk Jr doesn't care about or it's not a priority, does not prioritize health equity. When we're talking about everyone. Um. Um, Mr. Chair, I ask for unanimous consent to enter into the record. An op-ed from nine former CDC directors who served under both Republican and democratic presidents, titled we ran the CDC. Kennedy is endangering every American's health, as well as a report from my colleagues on the senate side, senator wyden and senator also brooks, which details the chaos and corruption of secretary 

[3:58:18 PM]

Kennedy's leadership. 
>> So I. 
>> Thank you. I yield the remainder of my time. 
>> Okay. A couple of comments and some questions for doctor fink. First of all, I just did a little check here. We right now have about four times as many people on snap as we did 20 years ago. I don't know what you want to do with that statistic, but it's illuminating. Um, now. Doctor fink, um, could you comment a little on the massive increase on pharmaceuticals, uh, going to young people today and, uh, um, are you working at HHS or fda working to study the impacts on this massive increase in pharmaceuticals or young children are having? 
>> Thank you, congressman, for your question. Absolutely. Our children's youth are now more than ever receiving way too 

[3:59:19 PM]

many medications instead of focusing on lifestyle changes first, which means focusing on what we were here to today to focus on which is fewer pills and better meals. When you think about mental health, we have our children's youth survey that comes out of the department of health and human services, of the children who experience mental health and behavioral health conditions, over half of them receive medications for these conditions. 
>> Oh my god. 
>> We need to look at the treatment regimens that we have, and we really need to work with our families, work with our schools to think about what are the root causes of these conditions. And when I share that, and I think it's unfortunate, this this entire discussion has really missed out on the crux of what we're here today to talk about, which is that we're at a crossroads in our country. And secretary Kennedy is the bravest 

[4:00:21 PM]

secretary in our country's history to take a stand and say, we will not stand for chronic disease in our country anymore. We are not just going to sit back and watch these obesity rates grow at such tragic ways that our children are going to be the unhealthiest generation of our lifetime. We are committed to saying we are no longer content with the sick health care system. We are no longer putting band-aids on on every condition that comes forward. And when when someone comes to see you in in the doctor's office, you know, saying, I'm depressed, here's your pill. We can't do that anymore. Now, that's not to say that there are medications that are important. And as a physician, I use medications all the time. But we have to go to the root cause and really treat each patient individually and not treat them as a cookbook where we say, you report symptom, here's your 

[4:01:22 PM]

pill, have a good life. You can consider stopping this medication at the end of your life, which will be much shorter because we never addressed your chronic disease. 
>> Thank you. Um, I have a very high opinion of secretary Kennedy. He's standing up to the drug companies. He's standing up to the junk food industry. And believe me, we all know the establishment is going to fight back. And I appreciate what you're doing. Um. Um, along with, um, secretary Kennedy. And I know it's got to be difficult, but I'll give you one more quick question. When you saw patients in your practice, how did you work to reverse chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes? And I'll mention again, as someone who goes to my local schools, it is obvious that the young people today are heavier than the young people. 

[4:02:24 PM]

When I was a child, when I look at people who've traveled around the world, it is obvious to them that America's children are fatter than the children in India, or the children in Italy, or the children in Sweden. It is obvious, and people ought to care about that, and they ought to demand a little bit of disruption and different sort of leadership in the department than they've had the last 20 years as American kids get worse. But could you, could you let us know what you did to try to reverse obesity and diabetes in young kids? 
>> Absolutely. And, you know, it's not just in children. It's in adults as well, because unless we treat adults as well, in the same way we're treating children with reversing chronic disease, we're not going to make a headway because of all the habits that are within families. And so when I when I treated patients, I would not just say, okay, you're here for 

[4:03:25 PM]

diabetes already. What are your blood sugars already? Check, check. Here's your medicine. Go have a good life. You know, we as as as physicians, we ask questions in terms of what they're eating, when they're eating, how they're eating, when they're exercising, and empowering with patients to have them check their blood sugar an hour after they eat, to realize how a given food impacts them. Because all of us respond differently, can work magic because they see how foods directly impact their blood sugar levels. And when you empower them to really see how food as well as movement. Because another I hope you know, someone had mentioned earlier, you know, about what they could take back to the people of your of your states. You know, even walking after eating more and more research shows that your blood sugar level goes down after you eat very quickly when you've walked right after eating. Doing these simple measures can make profound 

[4:04:26 PM]

impacts. So rather than just saying, oh great, you're come back for your follow up visit with me for diabetes, blood sugars are still high. Let's increase the insulin. It's more so how can we change what you're eating so that you don't have blood sugar fluctuations up and down all day? And so my message for you today is there is hope. And through secretary Kennedy's leadership, we are now encouraging medical schools and the accreditors to include nutrition in our education so that physicians and other allied health providers are empowered to give this important information to their patients to change health outcomes. 
>> Thank you very much. You want a closing remark? You want a comment? 
>> Uh, I, I'm encouraged to hear that solving childhood obesity, um, is a priority. Um, and that it's considered brave. 

[4:05:28 PM]

I think that was mentioned and that the goal is to see a decline in obesity rates. I think that is commendable. And so I want to give credit where credit is due. Um, Michelle Obama introduced let's move in 2008, which was, um, ridiculed by many of my Republican colleagues. Um, and so now to see, uh, rfk Jr, in a circuitous way, I should say, um, to, to to speak on that, um, um, if if he's the bravest, I think he would have to be, uh, second in line, uh, to the individual, uh, former first lady Michelle Obama, who initiated that initiative, um, in the first place. Um, the concern that we have is that it's important that we follow the science and we follow, um, 

[4:06:28 PM]

what the data tells us and what the data shows us, and we have to be consistent with it. We can't pick 1 or 2 issues that everyone agrees on and claim to be a champion. When we are looking at diseases that are preventable but that endanger lives. Having a resurgence because of messaging and policy decisions that are being made. Um, and so I hope that as a, um, as Americans, not just Republicans or Democrats, uh, we can start looking at these issues through a bipartisan lens. And if we're really serious about obesity, if we're really serious, serious about health care and making folks healthy, then let's actually follow the data and the science and do that as opposed to some of these fringe conspiracy theories that are being given 

[4:07:29 PM]

light and given a platform because of rfk Jr. Um, if rfk Jr is so brave, then stand up to these conspiracy theorists that he seems to empower and tell the truth. Tell the American people the truth. Lives depend on it, I yield back. 
>> Thank you. Um, one more comment on on. Uh, I guess we call him Bobby Kennedy. Huh? Um. He, uh, I read his book, you know, the real Anthony Fauci. Very percentage wise, not much of that book is about Anthony Fauci. Everybody ought to read it. I talked to the one of the heads of uw hospitals after I read the book, and I asked him if it was really that bad, you know, to the pharmaceutical industry, really run the medical industry in this country to that degree. And he told me, if anything, that book was understated. So just a recommendation to read that book. Um, I'll emphasize again, 

[4:08:30 PM]

77% of the 17 to 24 year Olds wouldn't qualify for military service. Every American should be scared to death when they hear that. And every American ought to know. We got a clean house in the medical establishment and the public health establishment that has led us a statistic out there. And things keep getting worse and worse. And I mention again, the number of people on food stamps in this country has gone up fourfold in the last 20 years. I mean, people ought to be scared about that, too, and say, what in the world is going on as we let these programs just continue to explode and the people aren't getting any healthier at all? Um. I, uh, I'd like to thank you, doctor fink, one more time for being here. Uh, I hope you guys don't give up. I've watched so frequently in my years in congress. The special interests at the end always get what they want. And I know that junk food lobby is hovering around here doing all they can to try to discredit, uh, secretary Kennedy. I know the 

[4:09:31 PM]

pharmaceutical industry must just dread when he was appointed in this job, and they're doing all they can to give ammunition to people to try to tear him down. I just encourage, doctor fink, when you get back to wherever you hang out with on a daily basis, that you let doctor, uh, I'm sorry, uh, secretary Kennedy know that a lot of people really appreciate, finally, after the number of people getting as the number of, uh, shots keeps going up over a period of years and, um, the number of mental health professionals keeps going up that we have somebody who questions the establishment. And, uh, that's why that's why we're glad he's here. In any event, I'd like to thank you guys for coming here. I know, uh, efforts were made to kind of, uh, change the topic. Uh, but you stuck on point, and, uh, like I said, I wish you a productive three and a half years. Um, I'll, um, uh, with, 

[4:10:35 PM]

with and without objection, with that, and without objection, all members have five legislative days within which to submit materials and additional written questions for the witnesses, which will be forwarded to the witnesses if there's no further business. Without objection, this subcommittee stands adjourned. I'll tell you. 
>> We need. 

[4:11:58 PM]

You.

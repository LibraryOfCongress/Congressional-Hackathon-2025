The subcommittee on Energy and Mineral

Speaker 2 [10:23:53 AM]
Resources will

Speaker 1 [10:23:54 AM]
come to order. Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare recess of the subcommittee at any time under Committee Rule 4F. Any oral opening statements that hearings are limited to the chairman and the ranking minority member. I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Fallon, be allowed to participate in today's hearing. The gentleman from Nevada, Mr. Amade be allowed to participate in today's hearing. The gentleman from Montana, Mr. Downing, to be be allowed to participate in today's hearing. Without objection, so ordered. And I'll recognize myself for an opening statement. From day one of his second term, President Trump has acted swiftly to put America on a path towards energy and mineral dominance. The bills we have before us today play a vital role in supporting this administration's efforts by codifying executive orders and making key legislative fixes needed to unlock our vast domestic

Speaker 2 [10:24:46 AM]
resources. First,

Speaker 1 [10:24:48 AM]
we have two bills geared towards unleashing coal on federal lands as energy demands continue to grow at a record breaking pace, increasing production of American coal is a logical solution that will provide reliable, affordable baseload power to areas of the country that need it the most, as well as our allies abroad. HR 1, the one big beautiful bill a signed into law by President Trump in July delivered historic wins for domestic coal production. HR 280, introduced by Representative Hagman would build upon these winds by undoing harmful actions taken by the Obama and Biden administrations as part of their quote war on coal, end

Speaker 2 [10:25:27 AM]
quote.

Speaker 1 [10:25:27 AM]
The bill would also codify key aspects of President Trump's executive order reinvigorating America's beautiful clean coal industry by creating certainty in the Department of the Interior's coal leasing process. HR 4068, introduced by Representatives Collins, also intends to fix duplicative coal permitting processes. This bill requires the Secretary of the Interior to identify all existing and potential categorical exclusions under NEPA, which would further the respons ible production and export of domestic coal. Next, HR 1366, introduced by Representative Amoda, would confront a key issue related to mining claims on federal land. In May of 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed a lower court's decision revoking and approved my plan for the Rosemont copper mine project in Arizona. now referred to as the Rosemont decision. This determination upended decades of regulatory and legal precedent, requiring that operators must prove the existence of a commercially developable deposit on a claim before a plan of operations can be approved. This ruling puts the cart before the horse and certainty and certain ancillary uses such as mill sites are a key factor in determining if a mineral deposit can be economically developed. HR 1366 would address this issue by creating a new kind of mill site that can be located within the boundaries of an approved mine plan of operations. Additionally, HR 1366 would establish an abandoned hard rock mine fund to assist with remediation efforts. Representative Amade's bipartisan legislation would cement the Rosemont fix into law and provide certainty for project sponsors seeking to responsibly develop much needed resources on our federal lands. Next, as deep sea mining emerges as a frontier for securing additional critical minerals, we must consider how to responsibly access these resources while advancing broader solutions for American energy and mineral independence. HR 4018, introduced by Representative Eel, takes the first step in advancing these efforts by codifying an executive order from President Trump to expand America's access to offshore critical minerals. Specifically, the bill would require the department, departments of commerce and the interior to develop reasonable permitting processes for deep sea mining will also requiring the departments to develop a seabed mapping plan. Next, HR 3872, introduced by Representative Fallon would amend the Men Releasing Act for acquired lands, clarifying that all lands acquired by the federal government are eligible to be considered for hard rock mineral leasing. The existing statute covers a wide range of resources, but leaves out hard rock minerals. As a result, acquired federal lands holding key resources such as vast lithium deposits in Texas have been effectively been locked up. HR 3872 would provide a much needed technical fix to this law, giving the Secretary of the Interior, the authority to tap into our vast mineral wealth across all types of federal

Speaker 2 [10:28:40 AM]
land.

Speaker 1 [10:28:41 AM]
Lastly, my bill HR 4090 would codify aspects of three executive orders relating to hard rock mining. First, this bill would mandate new studies on the cost of United States mineral import reliance, including from adversaries like communist China. HR 4090 would also require the administration to expedite priority mining projects on federal lands, identify federal lands suitable for new mineral production and accelerate geologic mapping efforts. Finally, this bill would direct the Secretary of the Interior to revise or rescind agency actions that hinder domestic mining, recommend changes to current law necessary to streamline mineral development and conduct a nationwide review of state and local laws that impede mineral development. As someone who has long championed responsible mineral development in places like northern Minnesota. Minnesota's Duluth complex, which is home to the largest untapped copper nickel find in the entire world. I know how vital it is to secure reliable domestic sources of the minerals needed to power our 21st century economy and our national defense. After all, it's not, if it's not grown, or if it's not mined. it doesn't

exist

Speaker 1 [10:30:01 AM]
I look forward to hearing from our witnesses on these important bills, and we'll, and will now yield to the ranking member and sorry for her opening statement.

Speaker 4 [10:30:09 AM]
Thank you, Chair Stauer. We are here today to discuss 5 mining-related bills that cut the American people out of decisions in the name of quote streamlining. We can all agree that we need safe and reliable access to critical minerals for the clean energy economy, for national security, and for the growing needs of technology, and I'm happy to work across the aisle to build it, but unfortunately, the bills on today's agenda don't get us any closer to that goal. Starting with HR 1366 bi par ti s an negotiations have markedly improved the mining regulatory Clarity Act, but this bill still raises as many regulatory questions as it answers. HR 1490 rubber stamps President Trump's broad sweeping executive order repealing common sense mining regulations and gives the industry even more power over our public lands, but deregulation is not the answer here. Even the industry will tell you projects go most smoothly when there is community support. Cutting out that public input like this bill would do in the name of streamlining permitting, does nothing but erode public trust and breed opposition. When community members can ask questions and have their concerns addressed projects get better. But that's impossible if you make the public the enemy. HR 4018 does the same thing, but this time in the deep sea. The bill directs NOA and Boem to expedite the process for issuing deep sea mining permits, both in our jurisdiction and in international waters. This summer, the Trump administration issued a press release laying out new permitting procedures for deep sea mi ning which eliminates entire steps from the leasing process, reduces environmental reviews and limits public input. This is a risky new industry that could profoundly harm our fisheries and oceans. Its impacts aren't well studied. Deep sea mining needs more study and public scrutiny, not less. Trump's press release also excludes states and coastal governments from the decision-making process for deep sea mining by eliminating a key task force. Maybe that's because the Trump administration doesn't like what they're hearing from local governments. The administration is pushing forward with authorizing deep sea mining of American Samoa, even though the government has come out firmly against deep sea mining off of its shores, and banned it in its territorial waters, but instead of listen ing to the American Samoan people's legitimate concerns about potential impacts on their fisheries, waters, economy, and culture. The Trump administration has decided to cut them out of the process. That's not streamlining, that's steam rolling. All coastal states, really all states, should be worried about the precedent that this sets. Equally concerning is this administration's move to unilaterally issue mining permits permits in international waters, which flies in the face of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. This will not make us any safer or more secure. It will only alienate us further from our allies and allow rivals like China to take similar actions, a race to the bottom that makes the whole world the loser. HR 4018 would have Congress codify and legitimize this administration's reckless deep sea mining moves. We need a whole of supply chain approach, from mining to processing to end use to build truly secure and resilient mineral supply chains. We must consider public input and ensure the benefits of domestic mining stay

Speaker 2 [10:33:52 AM]
local.

Speaker 4 [10:33:53 AM]
That's not what these bills would do. Beyond critical minerals, the two coal bills on the agenda are trying to artificially prolong the life of an industry that is on life support, as market forces like cheap renewable energy are driving coal's decline. These bills remove agencies' discretion in approving leases and look for ways to exempt coal from environmental reviews for production and export. This isn't even about American energy. It's about billionaire coal barons who refuse to face the

Speaker 2 [10:34:27 AM]
truth.

Speaker 4 [10:34:28 AM]
I stand firmly with coal communities and understand that folks need jobs in a healthy economy, but making false promises about coal coming back does not help. There are better, proven ways to build out American energy and secure our critical mineral supply chains in ways that are not just affordable and reliable, but good for people. Our environment and the climate. I look forward to hearing from Doctor Steve Feldge an experienced former interior official who also spent several years serving on the House Natural Resources Committee staff. Welcome back, and I yield back.

Speaker 5 [10:35:06 AM]
I thank the jailwoman, not her comments. I'm now going to be in our member panel and allow bill sponsors to speak on their legislation. I now recognize Miss Harriet Hagman from Wyoming's at-large congressional district for her testimony on her bill.

Speaker 6 [10:35:21 AM]
Thank you and thank you to Chairman Sauer for holding this legislative hearing today and for considering my bill HR 280, also known as the Coal Act. The Coal Act takes two critical steps for states involved with the federal coal program. First, it nullifies the Department of Interior's secretarial Order 3338, which placed a moratorium on new federal coal leases, and it also expedites the leasing process for qualified applications. For example, for any coal lease application that has already been commenced under Nipah. Since 1986, Wyoming has led the nation in coal production, producing about 40% of the nation's coal. Last year we produced 191 million tons and shipped over 171 million tons to 26 different states. While there is mining in different areas of the state. Wyoming is blessed with a significant amount in the Powder River Basin, the largest coal deposit in North America. Due to the presence of the BLM and other federal agencies in that basin much of our state's coal production is on federal land. In fact, we produce about 85% of all federal coal production. This reality make s us susceptible to misguided and nefarious federal policies. For example, in 2016, the Obama administration placed a moratorium on new coal leasing. The moratorium that moratorium that is addressed in this bill. This moratorium was reversed the following year, reinstated by the Biden administration in 2021, reimposed by a federal judge in 2022 and further delayed by the Biden administration in 2023. The federal government has found other ways to destroy Wyoming's coal production. For example, the Biden administration slowed the approval of mine plan amendments for other Wyoming projects and in 2024, the Biden administration amended the BLM Buffalo Resource Management Plan, which governs federal lands in the Powder River Basin, thereby choosing to pursue the quote no new leasing alternative, and thereby terminating all coal leasing by 204 1 This whip sign creates uncertainty that hampers the ability of coal companies to plan for the future, and it could lead to decreased production long before 2040, which was likely the intent of the Biden administration at the time. It was because of this federal campaign against coal that I first introduced the Coal Act in 2023 and rein introduced it again in this Congress. Since then, the 2016 moratorium was overturned by a federal judge and recognized by the Trump administration. Further, the working families tax cut bill signed by President Trump on July 1st. On July 4th made necessary reforms to coal leasing as well. As the Trump administration and the Republican Congress advance a pro-quoal agenda that will keep America America powered. I am interested to hear the expert testimony of our witnesses today and discuss ways which this legis legislation can be further strengthened to reflect the current state of federal coal policies and prescribe further protections in the future from the harms of the

Speaker 2 [10:38:45 AM]
past.

Speaker 6 [10:38:47 AM]
When the federal government tries to destroy Wyoming's coal industry. It ends up turning the lights out and the heat's off, the heat off in America. My legislation, which codifies key aspects of President Trump's executive order is yet another step in the right direction. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing today, and I yield

Speaker 2 [10:39:07 AM]
back.

Speaker 5 [10:39:09 AM]
I thank the gentle lady, I nel now yield to, um Mr. Mike Collins from Georgia's 10th Congressional District for his testimony on his bill, he recognized. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Across the country, energy projects are facing paralyzing delays because of outdated environmental review processes.

Speaker 1 [10:39:29 AM]
What,

Speaker 5 [10:39:29 AM]
uh, was once meant to be a tool for reasonable oversight has become a weapon used to block development, delay jobs, and drive up cost. Under the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA, major projects must go through a maze of reviews, red tape, and litigation. The average environmental impact statement now takes over 4 years to complete and often much longer. This is simply not sustainable if we want to remain an energy producing nation. This bill takes a focused and strategic step to address that problem. It codifies section 8 of President Trump's executive order reinvigorating America's beautiful, clean coal industry, which directed agencies to expand their use of categorical exclusions. Those are Nipah carve outs for projects that don't require full environmental studies, specifically the bill directs the Secretary of Interior to identify both existing and potential categorical exclusions that relate to coal production and export and to share that list with Congress within 30 days. It also encourages other federal agencies to adopt and rely on these exclusions under existing law, so we're not reinventing the wheel but we are making government work smarter. This is about cutting delays, not cutting corners. These exclusions already exist. We're just requiring agencies to use them more efficiently so that we can unlock American production, reduce permitting backlogs and help coal producing communities get back to work. Coal is powered this nation for generations. It still plays a vital role in our energy security, our exports, and our industrial base, but without reform, the regulatory burden will continue to strangle the industry and with it the jobs and communities that depend on it. It's time for Congress to pick up where President Trump left off, but executive orders alone are not enough. They can be reversed with the stroke of a pen by Fustra administrations as we've seen far too often. That's why it's critical that Congress act to take these reforms off shaky ground and put them into law. We need to move from temporary guidance to permanent policy. This bill does exactly that. It takes a key section of President Trump's executive order on reviving clean coal and makes it the law of the land, ensuring regulatory clarity, stability of our coal producers and a lasting commitment to American energy production. This is a modest targeted, and much needed step to reduce barriers, promote energy independence and ensure NEPA is applied in a reasonable, not punitive way. Thank you and I yell back. I thank the gentleman for his testimony. I now recognize Mister Pat Fallon from Texas's 4th Congressional District for his testimony and his bill. Uh, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm proud to sponsor a commonsense solution to unleash America's mineral wealth, of which we have in abundance. The mineral extraction for renewable industry and critical Applications Act, better known as America Act, would amend the mineral Leasing Act for acquired lands, Mallal by adding hard rock minerals as parts of deposits subject to lease under Milal so that all federally acquired lands can be considered for hard rock mineral leasing. Right now, in places like North Texas, an area that I represent proudly. We have valuable lithium deposits locked up on federal lands, and we can't utilize them. The America Act would give the Secretary of Interior the authority, and I would say the latitude to follow through on President Trump's executive order to ramp up mineral production on federal lands. A portion of our district falls within what is known as the smackover formation, which is a geological formation that encompasses areas from southern and eastern Texas across the Gulf states, all the way to the Florida Panhandle. And thanks to a recent US Geological survey led study that discovered that there is an estimated, now get this amount of between 5 and 19 million tons of lithium reserves in this formation, ready for us to tap into this mineral-rich deposit. The discovery of this wealth of critical minerals couldn't come at a better time as our overreliance on lithium imports, of course, from

Speaker 7 [10:43:47 AM]
China, uh, and other adversaries, uh, is at a natural high and it really undermines our national security. We're playing into the hands of the powers that be in Beijing. I'm sure Xi Jinping is excited about current regulations. By granting them a de facto control over the global lithium supply chain, whether through their domestic mines or ones that they've gained through other means such as the belt and Road initiative. The demand for lithium will only continue to increase as we embark on energy developments to address the growing burden on our power grid. This is better for the environment to for us to get it and extract it from the United States here. We have a strong environmental lobby. We have an independent judiciary. We have rule of law. We have an expertise in our country as a functioning representative republic, cares for more, far more for the environment than would any kind of communist or authoritarian dictatorship. By passing the America Act, we can take another step in the right direction that will tap our full potential of our national resources on federal lands. This will have a lasting impact on our economy, bolster US national security and ensure America stays a global leader for years to come. I spent 8 years in the Texas legislature, I would say, and I would consider this a cleanup bill, quite frankly, and uh take your pick. It's nonpartisan, bipartisan, and I would have filed this bill and really hope that it hit the floor if uh the minority was in the majority. I don' t think it has anything to do with political party. I think it has everything to do with what's in the best interests of the United States. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ay you back. I thank you gentleman

Speaker 5 [10:45:17 AM]
for his testimony. I now recognize Mr. Mark Amoda from Nevada's 2nd Congressional District for his testimony on his bill.

Speaker 8 [10:45:25 AM]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate your courtesy. Um, in May of 2022, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed a lower court decision revoking an approved mine plan of operation for the Rosemont copper mine project. located partially in the Colorado National Forest in Pima County, Arizona. The Ninth Circuit's decision limits the Forest Service's ability to approve mining, support activities necessary for including mining operations in federal land. This is no small matter. The entire economic viability of a mine can, can hinge on the ability to use surrounding lands for activities incidental to mining known as ancillary use. Ancillary use is kind of a key phrase because that's basically the way everybody had been doing it regardless of administration for over 4

Speaker 2 [10:46:21 AM]
decades And

Speaker 8 [10:46:22 AM]
so this legislation was required as kind of to straighten out the Ninth Circuit decision, um, so that the Forest Service and BLM and other public land managers that do NEPA in the context of permits like this, can have the predictability and stability that they earned, uh, and enjoyed before, um, I can tell you that this legislation has been passed twice. by the House of Representatives coming out of this committee as a standalone piece of legislation and once as an add-on to appropriations. So it's not, um, some new deal. Let's get the plow out and find an un plowed field. This merely restores what has been the decades long practice so that federal land managers are not left with confusion like, well, is it a Forest Service thing? Is it a BLM thing or whatever. And so I wanna thank uh the representative from, from my home state, Ms. Treacher, who will testify later, and I urge the committee's favorable support once again

Speaker 5 [10:47:26 AM]
I thank the gen gentleman for his testimony. I now recognize the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Western, for his testimony.

Speaker 2 [10:47:34 AM]
Thank you, Chairman Gosar. Uh, hard rock minerals are foundational to US national and economic security with applications across the defense, aerospace, energy, and manufacturing sectors of the economy.

Speaker 9 [10:47:46 AM]
Demand for these minerals is projected to rapidly increase in the coming years, placing strain on global supply chains, and we have to be ready for that. In fact, hard rock mining will need to increase sixfold in the future in order to meet domestic mineral needs. Unfortunately, the United States has become dang er ous ly reliant on mineral imports in recent decades. According to the US Geological Survey, we're forced to import 100% of nearly a quarter of the minerals on its critical minerals

Speaker 2 [10:48:16 AM]
list.

Speaker 9 [10:48:17 AM]
To make matters worse, our mineral dependency plays right into the hands of our adversaries, and most notably China controls approximately 60% of global critical mineral production, 90% of processing in 75% of manufacturing. We've repeatedly seen the CCP implement mineral export restrictions and leverage its stranglehold over rare earths as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations, prompting increased uncertainty across key sectors of our economy. Simply put, our reliance on foreign critical minerals is one of the greatest strategic vulnerabilities facing our nation today. To unleash our vast amount of natural resources, we must take decisive action to cut

Speaker 2 [10:49:00 AM]
through scores

Speaker 9 [10:49:01 AM]
of red tape and reverse years of hostility against domestic mining. and the particularly the actions of the Biden administration, which reversed project approvals and restricted development on millions of acres of public lands. According to S&P Global, it currently takes an average of 29 years for a critical mineral project to progress from the point of discovery to the point of production in the United States. Let me repeat that. 29 years from the for a critical mineral to progress from the point of discovery to the point of production. The only country in the world where it takes longer on average is Zambia. It must be really bad there. This unworkable timeline stems from permitting delays, regulatory uncertainty and risk of endless, frivolous litigation. Congress must enact comprehensive permitting reform to address this issue and allow domestic mining to thrive. National and economic security are not the only issues exacerbated by our lack of domestic mining. When we rely on foreign adversaries for our mineral inputs. It also leads to widespread labor, human rights and environmental abuse In the United States, we have the best labor and environmental standards across the globe. It is common sense that we should be doing more mining here to avoid reliance on minerals mined unethically through forced and child labor by the Chinese Communist Party.

Speaker 2 [10:50:22 AM]
Oh,

Speaker 9 [10:50:23 AM]
the committee went to Alaska last week and we uh went to, I believe it was the world's largest silver mine and their environmental and their safety record there was was second to none. Uh, we know how to mine minerals and uh we know how to do it.

Speaker 2 [10:50:40 AM]
um in, in environmentally approved manner, and we know how to do it in a safe manner, and it creates great paying jobs for American citizens. Unfortunately, the Trump administration has taken many steps to prioritize domestic hard rock mineral production, including issuing executive orders and common sense regulatory changes.

Speaker 9 [10:51:00 AM]
We'd like to applaud the Department of Interior and the USGS for releasing their drafts critical minerals List, which now includes copper, silicon, lead, as well as others that are essential for our country's national security as we move toward future advancements in artificial intelligence. The bills before us today will codify and build on these efforts, ensuring access to our nation's vast mineral wealth for future generations. I look forward to the robust discussion on this extremely important topic. I'd also like to mention, uh, and welcome our witness today, um, Mr. Sweets, who was a former uh constituent of mine in Arkansas's 4th congressional District. Welcome, Adam. that a heel back,

Speaker 5 [10:51:43 AM]
I thank the chairman. I now recognize the ranked member of the hopeful committee, Mr. Hoffmann, for his

Speaker 2 [10:51:47 AM]
5 minutes. Thank you, Mr.

Speaker 8 [10:51:49 AM]
Chairman. Good morning. Uh, before I begin, Mr. Chairman, I have a unanimous consent request.

Speaker 9 [10:51:54 AM]
Um, I

Speaker 8 [10:51:55 AM]
would like to enter into the record, uh, this article from CBS News yesterday. Uh, the headline is Climate Experts slam Energy Department report on greenhouse gasses. It is an international group of more than 85 climate experts and a 439 page review that they have completed,

Speaker 10 [10:52:14 AM]
uh, on how the Trump administration's Energy Department is failing to adequately represent current science on climate change, uh, misrepresenting the literature and cherry picking data. This is important to go into the record, Mr. Chairman, because while we debate legislation today to make carbon pollution great again and black lung and acid rain and everything else. There is a climate crisis and we should at least be honest about the science.

Speaker 5 [10:52:39 AM]
The order

Speaker 10 [10:52:40 AM]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh, on both sides of the aisle we're working towards, uh, the same goal, which is to secure a mineral supply chain that's reliable. And um sustainable, as my colleagues have mentioned, critical mineral supply chains are highly concentrated in a few countries, not all of them are friendly

Speaker 2 [10:52:59 AM]
to

Speaker 10 [10:52:59 AM]
the United States, we can agree that our supply chains are vulnerable, that we need to make them stronger and more sustainable and more resilient, but unfortunately, that's where our similarities seem to end because my Democratic colleagues and I want to maximize America's potential without leaving a path of destruction in our wake. Unfortunately,

Speaker 2 [10:53:21 AM]
um,

Speaker 10 [10:53:22 AM]
what, what I can tell you, Mr. Chairman, is I can, I can assure you we cannot mine our way out of this with brute force like the bills on today's agenda. According to the US Geological Survey, we don't even have the reserves in the ground. The United States cannot do this alone. We need to work with our allies to establish the safe and secure supply of minerals needed for the clean energy transition that is underway and instead today uh most mining in the United States is done by massive multinational conglomerates that extract publicly owned minerals without paying a cent back to the American taxpayers in royalties. That needs to stop. These corporations can then ship our minerals abroad for processing where they entered the global market with no commitment that they will ever end up back in the US economy and now the bills on our agenda today want to rush that process primarily by silencing people's voices. Before a mining company moves a mountain or drains hundreds of thousands of gallons of groundwater in a day or creates waste that is permanent hazard to clean drinking water. Don't you think that affected communities should at least have a say. Republicans are even letting mining companies have the deep sea. expediting domestic permitting there despite opposition from the American Samoan government. The deep sea mining industry hasn't proven that it can successfully operate. Um, but that's not stopping Republicans from asking, uh, from risking domestic and global conflict to assist a couple of billionaires who asked Donald Trump to help to save their risky investments. That's what this is about. HR 4018 directs NOAA to unilaterally authorize mining in international waters, ignoring global agreements and 170 countries negotiating a shared framework for deep sea mining. Sounds like a recipe for conflict and not for safety and security. That is not the way forward. During the last administration, Democrats took action to build the critical minerals industry that we need. After we passed advanced manufacturing and clean energy credits and the inflation reduction Act. Private industry announced $277 billion in investments in manufacturing here in America. That included important processing and midstream manufacturing that we need to take us from or to finished chip, battery, or solar panel. Crucially, it included the recycling industry that can help secure our su pp ly chains in the near term and set us on a path for a sustainable circular economy, but Republicans voted to effectively kill many of those tax credits in their big ugly bill.

Speaker 2 [10:56:04 AM]
Pulling

Speaker 10 [10:56:04 AM]
the rug out from under the processing plants and factories and costing Americans in anticipated 840,000 good-paying family sustaining jobs by 2030. These bills won't bring those factories back just as the giveaways for coal and two other bills on the agenda won't make coal dominant again. Cole had a time and a place. It powered the industrial revolution. Thank you, Cole. But uh we are long past steam engines

Speaker 2 [10:56:32 AM]
now.

Speaker 10 [10:56:33 AM]
And back then we didn't know the consequences of burning coal on our health and the climate. Today we do. Coal is simply too expensive and destructive to continue propping it up. If Republicans were serious about lowering cost s for people, they would stop resuscitating this dying, polluting

Speaker 2 [10:56:50 AM]
industry.

Speaker 10 [10:56:51 AM]
If they were serious, they would support the solar, wind, and battery industries instead of trying to suffocate them. Coal communities right now need new opportunities and diversified economies. They deserve more than empty promises that coal may someday be coming back, which is not. I look forward to hearing from today's witnesses, including Doctor Steve Felgus. Welcome back, Mr.

Speaker 2 [10:57:14 AM]
Felgus.

Speaker 10 [10:57:16 AM]
Served in the Biden administration with a focus on proactive reforms to improve the country's mining industry in ways that benefit both communities and the industry. Aye.

Speaker 2 [10:57:26 AM]
I think the

Speaker 5 [10:57:27 AM]
gentleman first that's right. We'll now move to our second panel, which is comprised of one witness. Let me remind the witness that under committee rules you must limit your oral statement to the 5 minutes. but your entire statement will appear in the your record. To be in your testimony, please press talk so we can all hear you. uh, and push the button on the microphone.

Speaker 11 [10:57:45 AM]
We use timing lights, so when you see green, you just go, yellow, and start to slow down, and when it's red, you got to stop. So with that, I I will allow the witnesses to testify with a four-member

Speaker 2 [10:57:56 AM]
question.

Speaker 11 [10:57:57 AM]
I will now recognize the gentleman from Arkansas. No, well, Mr. Seth, you are now recognized for 5 minutes.

Speaker 2 [10:58:06 AM]
Sorry

Speaker 8 [10:58:09 AM]
Mr. Chair, ranking member Ansari, members of the subcommittee, Chairman Westerman. thank you for the opportunity to provide the Department of the Interior's testimony on the bills before the subcommittee

Speaker 12 [10:58:21 AM]
today. My name is Adam C. I'm acting Assistant secretary, lands and Minerals Management at the Department of the Interior and is a privilege to be here today. At the Department of the Interior, we are working steadfastly and tire tirelessly to implement the president's energy dominance agenda. which is central to the country's economic, national, and energy security. Each of the bills advanced at today's hearing further that agenda and the Department of the Interior accordingly supports them without reservation. Under your capable and steady stewardship, Chairman Stauber, this subcommittee has been similarly diligent in implementing sensible and needed energy policies. And on behalf of the Department of the Interior, I convey our support and appreciation. The United States is blessed with an abundance of energy, natural resources, and the development of those natural resources, particularly oil and natural gas, coal, critical and rare earth minerals that are central to our country's future successes. Energy is an input into everything we do, use, and consume. In the energy sector drives our nation's economy, providing high paying jobs to millions of Americans and trillions of dollars in GDP. Since 2019, the United States has been a net energy exporter. That is a wonderful thing. It strengthens the United States' position on the world stage and enables our country tours to pursue more global peace and stability throughout the world. But this position of strength doesn't come inevitably. For 4 straight years, the prior administration attacked the domestic energy sector and its workers at every turn. Without exception on President Biden's watch, the full of federal government did all that it could to cripple domestic energy production, focusing the assault unyieldingly on oil and gas production, coal production, and other extractive energy

Speaker 2 [11:00:17 AM]
sectors.

Speaker 12 [11:00:19 AM]
Without which, of course, our collective prosperity, individual enjoyment, quality of life, and opportunity for advancement among so much else would immeasurably plummet. This is precisely why the work of the Trump administration and the work of this subcommittee is so important. Under Secretary Berham's leadership, the department is actively implementing the president's executive orders to unleash American energy and increase American mineral production.

Speaker 2 [11:00:46 AM]
HR

Speaker 12 [11:00:47 AM]
4090 would rightly codify provisions of these executive orders. As President Trump has reaffirmed American coal plays a pivotal part in our economy. It will continue to power the country for many decades to come. HR 280 and HR 4068. Further efforts already taken by this administration to support US coal production. by requiring the secretary to grant qualified lease coal applications and by nullifying the Obama administration's moratorium on new federal coal leases. The administration is also making significant efforts to ensure the successful development of other important minerals. President Trump has explained it is imperative for our national security that the United States take immediate action to facilitate maximum domestic mineral production and processing. HR 1366 and HR 3872 directly and precisely support that mission. Finally, the Trump administration is leading, and the responsible development of offshore critical

Speaker 2 [11:01:50 AM]
minerals.

Speaker 12 [11:01:52 AM]
HR 4810 aids this effort by accelerating data collection and establishing an expedited permitting process for the outer continental Shelf Lands Act. And so I reiterate, the policy is advanced by this bill, the bills before you today. Our common sense, rational, and much needed. The net result of which would further strengthen our country and further support our communities and our collective well-being. I thank you again, Mr. Chair, for the opportunity to be here today to express the Department of the Interior's support for the reasonable legislation before the subcommittee this morning.

Speaker 5 [11:02:28 AM]
The Department of

Speaker 12 [11:02:29 AM]
the Interior looks forward to continued engagement here and with the full natural Resources Committee. to ensure responsible development of the natural resources that power our economy, protect our national security, and support our livelihoods.

Speaker 2 [11:02:43 AM]
Thank

Speaker 12 [11:02:43 AM]
you, Mr. Chair.

Speaker 11 [11:02:44 AM]
I think the gentleman first yesterday were moved into questions. I wanna move to the chairman of the full Committee, Mr. Western, with various questions.

Speaker 9 [11:02:51 AM]
Thank you, Chairman Gosar and thank you uh for your testimony. Um, let's see,

Speaker 2 [11:02:56 AM]
uh. the um

Speaker 9 [11:03:02 AM]
USGS

Speaker 2 [11:03:04 AM]
has

Speaker 9 [11:03:05 AM]
recently updated its draft Critical Minerals list to include lithium. As you know, the smackover formation has incredible potential to meet the skyrocketing demands for lithium. How will HR 3872 uh help ensure

Speaker 2 [11:03:19 AM]
that those

Speaker 9 [11:03:20 AM]
lithium deposits are explored and developed uh reasonably.

Speaker 12 [11:03:24 AM]
I look at HR 3872, Chairman Westerman as

Speaker 2 [11:03:29 AM]
a

Speaker 12 [11:03:29 AM]
cleaning up, so to speak, of the federal statutory scheme. The BLM has many authorities to authorize mining of of different sorts on most of its lands that it manages, and I look at 3872 as authorizing those same practices, granting the BLM those same authorities on acquired lands. That's an appropriate step in the department's

Speaker 5 [11:03:52 AM]
view.

Speaker 9 [11:03:53 AM]
So how concerned is the department about our reliance on foreign nations. Obviously some of them adversarial for critical minerals needed in defense and energy technologies.

Speaker 12 [11:04:03 AM]
Well, you, you explained it perfectly, Chairman Westerman. It, it, it, that, that's it. I mean, it's a critical problem. It is perhaps, as you said, one of the most, uh, largest vulnerabilities that we have with regard to our national security. We have very, very little domestic production of critical and rare earth minerals here in the United States. We have even less processing. If we don't straighten that out the vulnerability only grows further. And, and, uh, the, the fact of the matter is, Chairman Westerman that is is not a short term fix. It's going to require immediate action, but it's going to require also sustained action. It's going to take investment uh, durable policies and so the bill that you referenced, chairman, is the right next

Speaker 2 [11:04:52 AM]
step,

Speaker 9 [11:04:54 AM]
right? And I'm glad you, you talked

Speaker 2 [11:04:55 AM]
about

Speaker 9 [11:04:56 AM]
processing and the, the long-term fix that's going to be required. We didn't get in this position overnight. Uh, you know, I find it appalling that we've got two copper smelters in the United

Speaker 2 [11:05:09 AM]
States

Speaker 9 [11:05:10 AM]
with such a huge demand for copper and last count I saw China's got over 50 of them, which just illustrates a, a bigger problem that we have, you know, we've mentioned that there's not enough critical minerals in the United States. I, I've, that's not uh congruent with the data that I've seen. Matter of fact, when we were in Alaska last week, just talking about the Ambler Road area of the, the, I think at the time there were 50 critical minerals on the, the critical minerals list and 49 of those just in the Ambler Road area could be mined in sufficient qu ant ities to meet the needs in the US. That's just one area in Alaska that's not talking about

Speaker 2 [11:05:53 AM]
northern

Speaker 9 [11:05:54 AM]
Minnesota. It's not talking about all the uranium deposits that were taken off the table to be mined north of the, uh, or in northern Arizona. Uh, I, I think if you look at all the places where we've said you can't mind. There, there may not be enough, but does the US have potential to provide these critical minerals and rare earth elements from our own resources.

Speaker 12 [11:06:19 AM]
Yes sir, no question about it. And, you know, we hear what you mentioned repeatedly is that the United States can't be self-sufficient on critical rare earth and other mineral production. We hear that routinely. And so, uh, it's a bizarre line of thinking, uh, in our view, because it's something akin to what we can't do it all by our by ourselves. So why would we even trouble to start at all. And that's not how we're looking at it at the Department of the Interior. How we're looking at it is let's get started and let's see what we can do. And to your point, we know, uh, with, with quite uh certainty what we have in portions of our subsurface. We don't have any idea the full landscape of it. The only way to do that with definitive answers, Mr. Chairman, is to begin the mining and see what we can produce. You know, America has proven itself time and again as one of the most capable, the most capable. uh, economies, full of the best and the brightest. I wouldn't bet against the US mining sector on this front either,

Speaker 9 [11:07:26 AM]
and even though we've tied our hands behind our back multiple times.

Speaker 2 [11:07:31 AM]
We,

Speaker 9 [11:07:31 AM]
we not only need to mind more, we also need to process and refine more and manufacture more, uh, that requires more energy and we've tied our hands on energy production as well, but I, I agree that we have the resources, we have the people, and we have the innovation that we can uh dominate in this area if we will just unleash ourselves, uh, to do so. You know, when I first came here, I was reminded of a, of an a parable by Aesop about an eagle flying high in the sky, and he was uh pierced by an arrow and as he did his death spiraled to the ground. He looked back at the air and said,

Speaker 2 [11:08:08 AM]
Alas,

Speaker 9 [11:08:10 AM]
I've been pierced by an arrow, uh, uh, feathered with my own plume, and that I think describes what we've done on natural resources policy in our country. We're killing ourselves with our own laws and regulations, and it's asinon when that happens, uh, and when we've got all of the, the stuff that we need in the ground, we just need to get it out of the ground and we know we can do that better than than anyone else. I'm way out of time, didn't realize that. I yield back.

Speaker 11 [11:08:40 AM]
I thank the gentleman voice, the ranking member for the subittee is now recognized as Hansor.

Speaker 13 [11:08:45 AM]
Thank you so much, Deputy Assistant Secretary sees there is an energy affordability crisis in this country, as you know, Prices are rising and are set to increase even further directly based on the decisions of the president, the Department of the Interior and Republicans in Congress. As much as you may try to deflect, it is undeniable that the cheapest form of energy is wind and solar, and yet this administration is waging war against renewables while making every attempt to prop up dirty, expensive coal. I'd like to ask a few questions about the Department of Interior's rush to approve coal mining permits despite the impact on electricity bills, public health, and the climate. Using authorities based on President Trump's so-called energy emergency. The Department of the Interior has greenlit at least 3 coal mines under expedited review. To dig into one example, the Hurricane Creek coal mine in Tennessee would strip, mine, reforeststed, conserved land in an area where residents and scientists are fighting the Cole legacy coal mines accountable for toxic mine waste in their water. Yet you approve the mine with a finding of no significant impact, according to you, no further environmental review was necessary. and this mine will primarily produce metallurgical coal, not coal for energy production. Is that correct?

Speaker 12 [11:10:13 AM]
Uh, I, I don't agree, ranking member, with the characterization on on green lighting and uh lighting and and rushing the review, the department, I stand by the Department of the Interior's work.

Speaker 4 [11:10:24 AM]
The question is about whether it's to primarily produce metallurgical

Speaker 2 [11:10:27 AM]
coal.

Speaker 12 [11:10:28 AM]
I believe, ranking member, that there is some metallurgical coal production, but there's also other coal production

Speaker 4 [11:10:35 AM]
The answer is yes, and even metallurgical coal has seen flat or declining demand in recent years as innovations in steel production actually require far less coal. You called these coal rubber stamps part of the administration's quote commitment to common sense permitting environmental stewardship and energy dominance, but I'm not seeing any of that. As for energy dominance and independence, all this push for coal is not making American families' energy bills any less any less expensive. In fact, in Michigan, ratepayers are on the hook for potentially hundreds of millions of dollars because the Trump administration used emergency powers to keep an old coal plant running past its planned retirement. Against the wishes of its local residents, the utility, and the grid operator. The administration extended the order again in late August over the objections of the local utility. If we want to talk about energy that's actually needed. Are you aware of how many gigawatts of energy are being held up by this administration's refusal to permit wind and solar.

Speaker 12 [11:11:45 AM]
I think it is always kind of a, a race between natural gas and coal. ranking member, I'm sorry for what is the most affordable source of energy. And so at the Department of the Interior in line with the president's energy dominance agenda. We are

Speaker 2 [11:12:03 AM]
focused

Speaker 12 [11:12:04 AM]
we are focused unyieldingly on processing, permitting base load, sustainable, reliable power to include greater production and natural gas

Speaker 4 [11:12:17 AM]
production. The question is, are you aware of how many gigawatts specifically of wind and solar have been held up. It's a yes or no

Speaker 2 [11:12:24 AM]
question.

Speaker 12 [11:12:25 AM]
What, what I would say is that

Speaker 2 [11:12:27 AM]
we

Speaker 12 [11:12:28 AM]
have limited resources. So at the Department of the Interior we have only so much staff. do

Speaker 4 [11:12:33 AM]
you know how many we

Speaker 12 [11:12:34 AM]
have only so much budget and so we have to prioritize the work that we're going to do. because we only have, like I said, limited resources. And so in line with the president's agenda, what we are focused on is working tirelessly

Speaker 4 [11:12:49 AM]
as I mentioned the harms community. So it seems you don't know the precise number. You haven't been focused on it. According to Republican Governor Lombardo of Nevada, over 33 gigawatts of planned solar and battery storage are being impacted in Nevada alone. Over 3 gigawatts of offshore wind that is almost ready to come online and deliver affordable power to American families, but this administration is working to pull the plug. It's clear that this is not about an energy emergency or reducing people's energy bills. Otherwise, why would this administration be canceling every energy project that's already under construction. and throwing up roadblocks for the fastest, cheapest and safest forms of energy available. I yelled back.

Speaker 11 [11:13:42 AM]
I think the gentlewoman for her testament questions. I now look to him, a gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Crane for his 5 minutes of

Speaker 2 [11:13:48 AM]
questions.

Speaker 8 [11:13:50 AM]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Uh, Mr. C, as you may be aware, the state of Colorado is moving forward with plans to close all of its coal-fired power plants. By 2031, well before they reached their natural retirement age. And as of 2024, Colorado's remaining coal plant still generated about 1/3 of the state's electricity. That means that Colorado is gonna have to replace a third of its power generation in just 5 years, leaving utilities scrambling to secure new sources of electricity. Hopefully, at affordable prices, uh, the ranking member mentioned in her opening statement that, that I think she called it, quote, cheap renewables,

Speaker 9 [11:14:35 AM]
uh,

Speaker 10 [11:14:36 AM]
they're

Speaker 8 [11:14:36 AM]
displacing coal, especially when you have a state like Colorado

Speaker 2 [11:14:40 AM]
mandating that that happened.

Speaker 8 [11:14:43 AM]
um, but analysis has shown in Colorado that shutting down coal plants will increase Colorado bills, uh, utility bills by $75 a

Speaker 2 [11:14:54 AM]
month.

Speaker 8 [11:14:56 AM]
Now, when Colorado Springs Utilities, which is, uh, utility company in my, uh, city, in my community, when they went out to bid to bring additional renewable capacity online, prices were 60% higher than they expected. So Coloristre utilities pivoted. They had to go to natural

Speaker 2 [11:15:16 AM]
gas.

Speaker 8 [11:15:17 AM]
Colorado Renewables were subsidized They were never cheap

Speaker 2 [11:15:22 AM]
Otherwise,

Speaker 8 [11:15:23 AM]
utilities would be adopting them in droves. What's actually happened was that the Biden administration and states continue to manipulate the energy market, and that is a fact. And I, you know, I, I sit here and I listen to this stuff. And I hear

Speaker 2 [11:15:39 AM]
folks,

Speaker 8 [11:15:40 AM]
particularly on the other side. and, and, and we know what it is. It's this adherence to the religion. of their climate

Speaker 2 [11:15:47 AM]
change.

Speaker 8 [11:15:49 AM]
But the reality is, there are people in my community that are paying $75 more a month. Now

Speaker 2 [11:15:57 AM]
that may not matter

Speaker 8 [11:15:59 AM]
if you live in some big mansion. in San Francisco or in some other place, but people in in my community, live in the real world. $75 a month is a lot.

Speaker 2 [11:16:13 AM]
and it is absolutely

Speaker 8 [11:16:17 AM]
criminal, that we continue to, to pass on because of that agenda, we continue to pass on higher utility rates, and we cause single moms to have to choose whether they're going to buy their kids a new pair of shoes or send their kids to camp.

Speaker 2 [11:16:33 AM]
over the

Speaker 8 [11:16:33 AM]
summer, and we sit here and sanctimoniously preach about stuff being cheap renewables. Give me a break. While we take base load

Speaker 2 [11:16:44 AM]
off the table

Speaker 8 [11:16:46 AM]
I want to be clear, the states won't bear these costs. It's the ratepayer who bears the cost. This year alone in Colorado, 3 coal-fired power plants are scheduled to close. Craig unit one in Craig, Comanche 2 in Mr. Hurd's district in Pueblo. Both of those are in Mr. Hurd's district, and Pawnee Station in Brush. To meet its self-imposed emissions targets. The state is forcing Coloradans to pay more just to turn on their lights. or to heat their homes. That's the reality

Speaker 2 [11:17:20 AM]
of this

Speaker 8 [11:17:22 AM]
For example, Xcel Energy estimated it'll cost 1.4 billion $1.4 billion to close its coal plants. Every dollar of that will fall on residential and commercial customers. Unless what? The government comes in and subsidizes it again. By the way, we're $37 trillion in debt. By 2031, this could raise electricity bills by 20 to 50%, up to $75 a month in Colorado. Affordable and reliable energy must remain accessible to everyone, and Cole continues to be one of the cheapest and most dependable base load power sources in our country. Finally, at Ray Nixon, uh, power plant that we just went to a trip, uh, with the Western Caucus. That's in my district that provides s te ad y base load power, natural gas is available to meet peak demand and solar serves as an intermittent

Speaker 2 [11:18:21 AM]
source.

Speaker 8 [11:18:23 AM]
That's what's allowed Colorado Springs Utilities to deliver reliable and affordable power, I guess my one question, Mr. Sis, do you believe coal will continue to play an important role in providing reliable base load power for our grid.

Speaker 12 [11:18:39 AM]
Without a shadow of doubt

Speaker 2 [11:18:41 AM]
OK,

Speaker 8 [11:18:42 AM]
thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. I thank

Speaker 11 [11:18:44 AM]
the gentleman for his questions.

Speaker 10 [11:18:45 AM]
Mr. Chairman, I have unanimous consent request. Uh, this, uh, would like to enter into the record of July 22nd. uh, report on a global study showing that 90% of renewables worldwide are cheaper than fossil

Speaker 2 [11:19:00 AM]
fuels.

Speaker 10 [11:19:01 AM]
So, uh, we are going deep through the looking glass here in this alternate reality, if there's any religion, uh, on this subject, it is the religion that is sacrificing American consumers at the altar of higher energy bills for fossil fuel industry

Speaker 11 [11:19:18 AM]
without objection. The gentlewoman from California, Miss Rebus is recognized for her 5 minutes questions

Speaker 14 [11:19:29 AM]
Um, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for recognizing me and thank you Principal Deputy, um, cease for joining us today. I'm hoping you can answer a few quick questions on the expedited deep sea mining process that HR 1366 would codify into law. Uh, the Department of Interior recently announced new permitting procedures for deep sea mining that will cut out the state task force that informs the leasing process, as well as removal of important compliance steps. These updated procedures will reduce environmental review and effectively cut out public input, uh, through so-called emergency permitting procedures. Coastal states should have more input, not less, over a risky experi ment al industry that can have generational effects on their communities.

Speaker 2 [11:20:23 AM]
Uh, Mr. Seuss, yes or no, can you commit that any expedited procedures, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management implements involve meaningful input from coastal state governments.

Speaker 12 [11:20:35 AM]
Yes, ma'am. Happy to meet with any state government that contacts the office.

Speaker 14 [11:20:40 AM]
Yes or no, are there revenue sharing structures in place for offshore mineral leasing, so coastal governments can take part in any potential benefits.

Speaker 12 [11:20:50 AM]
It's certainly a policy the department is considering.

Speaker 2 [11:20:53 AM]
OK.

Speaker 14 [11:20:54 AM]
Uh, there's, you know, there's not a, there's not a guaranteed revenue at all because the secretary can set whatever minimum royalty he or she wants or waive it entirely. Uh, the Trump administration is making a big assumption that there will be any revenue at all, because a comprehensive analysis is found, the business case for deep sea mining just doesn't add up. I ask for unanimous consent to enter the ocean Foundation's February 2024 report entitled Deep Sea Mining Isn't Worth the risk into the record. Thank you. Uh, the Ocean Foundation's report clearly states the extreme risks of seabed mining, and the needed precautions that 27 countries and over 800 scientists and the fishing industry are calling for. This is exactly what states like California have already figured it out. When I was in the California State Legislature. I led efforts to ban seabed minings on state waters in California. We do not have time to wait for the next crisis, or emergency that kills millions of species, destroys thousands of small businesses along the coast and cost billions in cleaning up before federal action is taken. We need to act now. California didn't wait for another emergency. We took steps to ban seabed mining. The benefits of seabed mining are not worth the harm to the environment and small businesses along the

Speaker 2 [11:22:27 AM]
coast,

Speaker 14 [11:22:28 AM]
which is why Oregon and Washington have also taken steps to ban this hazardous practice. Meanwhile, the Trump administration and House Republicans will stop at nothing to allow industry to do what it likes to boost profits without regard of how their actions could result in a major crisis that destroys the lives of millions of Americans. Thank you, and I yield back.

Speaker 11 [11:22:53 AM]
Thanks gentlemen, the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Herd is recognized for 5

Speaker 2 [11:22:57 AM]
minutes. Thank

Speaker 9 [11:22:59 AM]
you very much, Mr. Chairman, uh, Deputy Assistant

Speaker 2 [11:23:01 AM]
Secretary cease in your testimony, you emphasized the importance of coal for America's economic security. Uh, in my Colorado district, the city of Pueblo has a fully functional coal-fired unit that faces early retirement because in my view of short-sighted government policy. Uh, this relates and raises serious concerns about reliability, affordability, and also the ability to meet growing demand. From your perspective, what are the long-term national security and economic consequences of taking these kinds of plants like the Comanche unit in

Speaker 15 [11:23:35 AM]
Pueblo offline early.

Speaker 12 [11:23:37 AM]
I think it's a huge problem, Congressman, because coal, as we've discussed, provides communities like yours with reliable and affordable baseload power. And if we are decreasing existing base load power, then we are putting ourselves at a disadvantage relative to others on the national stage. The point that I think most of us agree on is that there will be an extreme growth in energy demand over the coming uh years. And the last thing we can afford to do, if we're interested in

Speaker 2 [11:24:15 AM]
that,

Speaker 12 [11:24:16 AM]
to be quite honest, even if we're not interested in pursuing that, uh, AI arms race. The last thing that we can afford to do is to shut down ongoing sustainable, uh, uh, base load, affordable, power for communities like yours.

Speaker 15 [11:24:33 AM]
Our intermittent resources like wind and solar are able to meet the low demands consistently that AI and other data centers

Speaker 2 [11:24:41 AM]
uh

Speaker 15 [11:24:41 AM]
require in terms of electric demand on the grid.

Speaker 12 [11:24:43 AM]
No,

Speaker 2 [11:24:44 AM]
sir.

Speaker 15 [11:24:45 AM]
And can you talk to us about um the levelized cost of energy. Do you have any information you might be able to provide us about when we talk about the cost of various resource uh mixes, how baseload generation would compare uh to coal or natural gas versus other resources that are not always on 24/7 in terms of transmission costs, in terms of backup costs, battery costs, um, peaking demands, things like that.

Speaker 12 [11:25:12 AM]
Yes, sir. So, so it is a bit uh nuanced and, and, and regional, depending on which part of the country you're talking about for all the obvious reasons, different characteristics of, of energy supply And so it, it can be a detailed conversation, but the bottom line that really is not up for debate that you, that you point out, Congressman, is that because wind and solar are not base load. They're not, they're intermittent And because they need battery backup in the best case that that isn't even currently available, then you have to duplicate. on the grid with backup baseload power. So the levelized cost of energy has like many things, become a point of contention, but there

Speaker 2 [11:26:02 AM]
is

Speaker 12 [11:26:03 AM]
no debate

Speaker 2 [11:26:04 AM]
that

Speaker 12 [11:26:05 AM]
when it comes to affordable power,

Speaker 2 [11:26:08 AM]
coal,

Speaker 12 [11:26:09 AM]
and natural gas lead the pack in that intermittent energy sources for the reasons that you mentioned. are, are at the, at the back. And, and oftentimes, oftentimes congressman, 6789, 10 times as expensive as coal and natural

Speaker 2 [11:26:25 AM]
gas.

Speaker 15 [11:26:26 AM]
Thank you for that. Uh, one other thing I wanted to point out is that wind and solar depend on imports of rare earths, polysilicon, and critical minerals, much of which comes from China and I'm not sure that that dependency is necessarily factored into the arguments about cost and the cheapness of renewables, um. Mr. Sis

Speaker 2 [11:26:46 AM]
is

Speaker 15 [11:26:47 AM]
an energy source cheap if it makes us dependent on adversaries, uh, for supply chains?

Speaker 12 [11:26:53 AM]
No, sir. And if I, if I might, I think there are a lot of circumstances that aren't introduced into this debate. You mentioned one of them, but there's a lot of other things that are unique to intermittent power sources that are conveniently neglected in this debate, but of course, if you are dependent on adversaries for an input into the infrastructure to produce the energy. That's not a good spot to be

Speaker 2 [11:27:16 AM]
in.

Speaker 15 [11:27:18 AM]
Thank you very much uh for that testimony, Mr. Sis. With that, Mr. Chairman, I go

Speaker 2 [11:27:22 AM]
back.

Speaker 11 [11:27:25 AM]
I thank the gentleman for his questions. I now recognize Miss Lee from Nevada for her next 5 questions.

Speaker 13 [11:27:31 AM]
Uh, thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's uh nice to see you. Thank you for being here. Uh, I represent Nevada,

Speaker 2 [11:27:37 AM]
the Silver State, and

Speaker 13 [11:27:39 AM]
so I don't have to tell anyone in this room, uh, that mining has long been and remains central to our economy and today's discussion regarding the mining regulatory Clarity Act in particular, is an important one for our state. So I'm going to focus a few questions on that, Mr. Sis. Um, I wanna ask about some refinements to uh the version of the MRCA before us today that will keep the bills, uh, Rosemont fixed firmly intact, while further clarifying congressional intent to heat off any potential abuse or misuse. Um, rather than trying to respond because it's a sort of in the weeds. Um, I just, uh, and with our time constraints, I'd like to ask you to follow

Speaker 16 [11:28:26 AM]
up in writing to my questions if that's OK.

Speaker 12 [11:28:29 AM]
Yes, ma'am. I'm happy to do

Speaker 16 [11:28:30 AM]
it. All right. First, uh, in keeping with the long-held assumption that a claim holder is a prudent man, quote unquote, if they're proposing to invest resources in developing a mine. With the DL, the Department of the Interior uh support the addition of language to the MRCA that would simply make it explicit uh in this legislation that the use and the occupancy of a mill site is contingent upon the development of a valuable mineral deposit on a ballot claim. And again I'll ask you to uh provide that in writing and relatedly, the MRCA currently states that a proprietor may locate quote unquote as many mill site claims as a reasonably necessary for its operation. Now, bipartisan, fair-minded organizations like Trout Unlimited have cautioned that the term reasonably necessary is well-intentioned but imprecise and could inadvertently allow actors to claim an unlimited amount of mill sites. Uh, so with that in mind, I, I'm asking if the uh department would have any objection to a small but significant revision to the build text striking the word reasonably and adding the word only that is specifying that a particular or proprietor may locate only as many mill site claims as are necessary for its operations. Again, this is very in the weeds, so, um, sorry to get very technical, but these are important refinements to this bill. We have had experience in Nevada where interpretations have led to led to misuse and abuse. So as we're considering this, this would be helpful if we could address that. Um, finally, the MRCA also includes a savings clause which establishes that mining companies would still have to be able to prove that there was a va lu able mineral deposits on any claims with it lands that have been withdrawn from mining such as national parks. Um, while it was added in good faith, this inclusion of the savings clause has prompted concerns that the exclusion of similar language regarding claims on unwidrawal lands could be read by a court to imply that Congress somehow intended to eliminate or prevent validity claims on such lands. Again, I ask that the department uh take a look at that. And um finally, I wanted to clarify, I want to move on to another important industry in Nevada, which is the solar industry and take this time to ask for some clarity from you and the Trump administration. This morning, um, because this is such a crucial industry to our economy as well. I mean, Nevada could, is called the Silver State. It could also be called the solar state. Um, you know, and this is a quote from our governor in a letter that he wrote to your secretary, to your boss that Nevada, that um mine that that solar is crucial to our state's economic future and will contribute to the nation's energy dominance and independence. This is from our Republican governor, um, and so what we are seeing, uh, he alerted you that this new red tape requiring the signoff from the secretary, uh, on virtually every permit related to solar energy development has frozen key projects in our state that promised billions in economic benefits. Nevada, he emphasized cannot afford to walk away from these benefits, and they're transformational effects on our economy. So I would hope, and I'm asking, uh, what the DOI is doing with solar is not necessarily reform, but weaponization. And uh and so I'm asking if you will commit to working with the solar industry as well as federal and state leaders from both parties to address the bipartisan concerns regarding this new approach to solar.

Speaker 12 [11:32:54 AM]
Uh, yes, ma'am. One thing I pride myself on, me and my team is taking meetings as they are requested. We don't say no to anybody. So to the extent that someone wants to to uh interact and work with the department. We are open for

Speaker 16 [11:33:09 AM]
business. That's great. I, I do believe, Governor Lombardo has not received a response to this letter, so we look forward to follow up on that. Thank

Speaker 2 [11:33:18 AM]
you. I

Speaker 11 [11:33:19 AM]
think the general lady for her questions. I now recognize the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Roselle Fur to introduce his bill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Speaker 5 [11:33:26 AM]
My bill HR 4018 codifies President Trump's executive order to unleash American offshore critical minerals and resources. This bill directs agencies

Speaker 14 [11:33:36 AM]
within the department of the interior

Speaker 5 [11:33:38 AM]
of commerce to fast tracking licensing, exploration, and commercial

Speaker 2 [11:33:43 AM]
recovery of seabed minerals. Under the Biden administration, our minerals

Speaker 5 [11:33:48 AM]
have been locked away and unable to be used while countries like China

Speaker 12 [11:33:52 AM]
have been mining

Speaker 2 [11:33:53 AM]
these resources

Speaker 5 [11:33:54 AM]
for years. The United States must be the leader in this field, and we must strengthen our independence

Speaker 2 [11:34:00 AM]
toward critical minerals. My bill is simple. It aims to unlock critical

Speaker 5 [11:34:04 AM]
minerals located offshore. Doing so will increase the domes tic ation of resources, strengthen our national security and ensure responsible development of seabed minerals

Speaker 2 [11:34:16 AM]
and

Speaker 5 [11:34:16 AM]
perhaps most importantly, not only does HR 4018 increase mineral supplies that it can also massively bolster our defense supply chain by establishing domestic technology and reducing strategic vulnerabilities. HR 418 is vital for the success of the American economy. Technology innovation and our national security and represents an important step towards strengthening US critical minerals independence. Uh, Mr. Seeds, can you highlight, uh, some of the actions the department, your department has taken to support this

Speaker 2 [11:34:55 AM]
effort

Speaker 12 [11:34:57 AM]
Yes, sir. Thank you, Mr. Congressman. So you're, you're exactly everything you say is is spot on. And so the secretary supports all of the policies in the bill. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management has done great work over the past months to, to fully wrap its arms around this issue and to begin to get things done. So, uh we have uh streamlined some of our permitting and, and processing procedures, of course, the legislation, uh, makes

Speaker 2 [11:35:26 AM]
that

Speaker 12 [11:35:28 AM]
statutory law, and we support that because as you say, it is, it is time to begin mining offshore and offshore, uh, in this country again for, for all sorts of reasons, economic and national security. So Boha is looking at at has done that work and Boha is also considering some regulatory revisions that haven't been, you know, those, those regulations that govern uh deep sea mining haven't been touched since the 80s, if I'm not mistaken. So we are also looking at that. Uh, I will, I will, sir, if, if I could just also highlight that Boha as it does with all of its other activities continues to engage thoughtfully and thoroughly with all of the stakeholders.

Speaker 2 [11:36:17 AM]
Yeah, they've been very few, uh, very

Speaker 5 [11:36:20 AM]
much overdue updates since uh Deep seabed, hard mental Resources Act was passed in 1980. And uh could you just give us a couple of show us what tell us what a few of your efforts have been to to update some of the data.

Speaker 12 [11:36:35 AM]
Gladly, sir, and, and, and some of that, most of that comes out of the US Geological Survey, and, uh, and of course, as you know, another one of Secretary Berham's priorities is, is map, baby map. And what, what he focuses on with, with that slogan is that

Speaker 2 [11:36:53 AM]
he,

Speaker 12 [11:36:54 AM]
as, as the steward of these natural resources can't effectively do his job without knowing what we have. And so, one critical thing that we intend to do, we will do under Secretary Bergen's leadership is to, is

Speaker 2 [11:37:11 AM]
to

Speaker 12 [11:37:12 AM]
the best we can fully understand what resources we have in the, in the seabed floor and authorized, permit and authorize the responsible development of those. That's the target, and we're on, on our way there. Your, your bill aids in that effort, and so we appreciate that.

Speaker 5 [11:37:29 AM]
Thank you. Uh, how does, uh, our bill HR 4018 reduce United States independence, particularly from China of seabed minerals. Yes, sir, those

Speaker 12 [11:37:42 AM]
minerals that we have on the seabed bed are, are, are an input into every technological device that we use in this country. They're also a key input into a lot of uh military uh tools. And it's, it's remarkably uh near-sighted for us to be continuing down this path. So I'm thankful under President Trump's leadership that we are right sizing, rectifying our, our approach consistent with the policies addressed in your bill to be begin a, a path of, uh, self-direction and, and, and, and kind of uh determining our, our course for the future rather than being dependent on adversaries for supply chain

Speaker 5 [11:38:29 AM]
Thank you, sir. Mr. Chairman, I yield

Speaker 11 [11:38:31 AM]
back. I think the gentleman from Mississippi, the gentleman from Rhode Island, Mr. Magazine who was recognized for his five minutes of

Speaker 17 [11:38:36 AM]
questions. Thank you, Chairman. Mr. Sis, I come from Rhode Island, where we have been hurting with high energy costs, high electricity costs, in particular for years, and relief is finally in sight because the revolution Wind Project, an offshore wind development is contracted to deliver more than a third of my state ' s electricity demand at well below the market rate, saving Rhode Islanders on their energy bills, lowering the cost of business for manufacturers while employing hundreds of American workers. But two weeks ago, you halted the project and I wanna know why. To be clear, this project is already 80%

Speaker 2 [11:39:22 AM]
complete.

Speaker 17 [11:39:23 AM]
There are 45 turbines sitting off the coast of my district that have already been built. and are ready to deliver power to the grid. So why have you stopped this project? Because I have to stop work order here. and it gives no clear rationale whatsoever.

Speaker 2 [11:39:40 AM]
Sir, the

Speaker 12 [11:39:42 AM]
revolutionin project like all offshore wind projects is under review at the Department of the Interior consistent with the president's January

Speaker 17 [11:39:51 AM]
under review for what?

Speaker 12 [11:39:53 AM]
It's under review for uh, as, as explained in the president's January 20th memorandum and, and that it, it, it requires that we work with, obviously not just folks inside the Department of the Interior, but also folks, our colleagues at several other agencies, many other agencies, and so with

Speaker 17 [11:40:16 AM]
I'm gonna stop you there because this project was already thoroughly vetted and approved. by Boha by the Department of Interior, by the Department of Defense, by every relevant regulator. It has been contracted to deliver energy to the grid. It has already been 80% built, and every day that this project is halted with no clear rationale for why is a day that hundreds of workers face the unemployment line, and that my constituents are stuck with higher electric costs. And also, by the way, we talk about energy independence and achieving American energy dominance. This is American-made energy. American workers, American jurisdiction, right off the coast of my state. So I'll ask again because we've got no clear answer from the administration. We have no clear answer in the stop work order. What is being

Speaker 2 [11:41:12 AM]
reviewed?

Speaker 12 [11:41:14 AM]
Sir, the stop work order, I think, speaks for itself and respectfully, as I said, the project is under the review, consistent with the president's memorandum of January 20th, and because it's under review, because of the reasons listed there in the stop work order. I have nothing more to

Speaker 17 [11:41:30 AM]
say at this with all due respect, I have the stop work order right here. It is one page long. I, I can give it to you if you'd like to review it again. It provides no reason for why work has been stopped. It provides no explanation for what is being reviewed or how long we are going to have to wait for this review or who's conducting

Speaker 2 [11:41:47 AM]
it.

Speaker 17 [11:41:48 AM]
We have heard nothing from the administration. So I have this opportunity with you here, can you tell us what is being reviewed? Why has the work been

Speaker 2 [11:41:55 AM]
stopped?

Speaker 12 [11:41:56 AM]
As I said, Congressman, I think that the stop work order speaks for

Speaker 17 [11:41:59 AM]
itself.

Speaker 12 [11:42:01 AM]
What I, what I would add only is

Speaker 2 [11:42:04 AM]
that

Speaker 12 [11:42:05 AM]
because the project is under review, and consistent with the president's January 20th memorandum. I have nothing more to say at

Speaker 17 [11:42:11 AM]
this point. Listen, I, I, I, I appreciate that. but like with all due respect, bullshit. Like there's nothing here in this stop work order that says, why work has been stopped, no rationale has been presented. This this project was fully approved, fully permitted by every relevant agency I have met in Rhode Island with iron workers and laborers and electricians and pipefitters who are now facing unemployment and have no idea why, can't plan because they don't know how long this stoppage is going to last. They don't know what to tell their families and we are heading into winter, where electricity costs, energy costs, spike. And we don't know what to tell our constituents about how long they're going to have to wait for this energy to be delivered to the grid. I mean, do your agency oversees this. Do you know what price of electricity that Revolution One project is contracted to deliver to Rhode Island.

Speaker 12 [11:43:07 AM]
I have heard different characterizations of the price. So they

Speaker 17 [11:43:10 AM]
are contracted. It's a contract in writing with our electric utility to provide power at 9 cents a kilowatt hour. 9 cents a kilowatt hour, that is less than half of our market rate for electricity. People are desperate for lower energy prices for American-made energy for American jobs. This project delivers all of that, and you all have stopped it, and you can't tell us why. You have failed to articulate why today the stop work order has failed to articulate why the administration has given no explanation at all. It is unacceptable. It is hurting my constituents. It is hurting our country, and we need answers, Ayo back.

Speaker 11 [11:43:50 AM]
I thank the gentleman. I'll acknowledge myself for the next 5 minutes. So, uh, technologies is gonna really help us, is it not, Mr. Sis? I'm sorry, Technology. Yes,

Speaker 2 [11:43:59 AM]
sir.

Speaker 11 [11:44:00 AM]
OK, so, um, coal and the intermediate area, they have, they found lots of reserves of, of, uh, rare earth, right? Critical minerals?

Speaker 12 [11:44:08 AM]
Yes, sir.

Speaker 11 [11:44:09 AM]
So to get to that, you got a mind and there's coal there, so it's, and there's another supplant of additional revenues, right?

Speaker 12 [11:44:16 AM]
Yes, sir, correct.

Speaker 11 [11:44:18 AM]
Now, my understanding about lithium is, uh, uh, slumberjay. You're familiar with Slumberjay, right? Yes,

Speaker 12 [11:44:24 AM]
sir.

Speaker 11 [11:44:25 AM]
Seismic Group.

Speaker 12 [11:44:26 AM]
Yes, sir. And

Speaker 11 [11:44:27 AM]
what they're, what they're doing is actually, uh, they need lots of water for lithium,

Speaker 2 [11:44:31 AM]
right?

Speaker 12 [11:44:32 AM]
I believe that's right. Yes, sir.

Speaker 11 [11:44:34 AM]
So the first question is, is Mills. We're talking about Mills' new uh way of uh pulverizing minerals and and whatnot. Why would we put any limitations on that because we're still looking at how, how it plays out,

Speaker 2 [11:44:48 AM]
right?

Speaker 12 [11:44:49 AM]
Yes, that's correct.

Speaker 11 [11:44:50 AM]
OK, so with lithium, they can actually, when they tag into a lower aquifer, like, are you familiar with the Harkohela underneath the Buckeye, Arizona. I'm not. It's a big lake underneath it. It's got lots of resorts, but it's heavy in metal, heavy metals and arsenic laden. And what they do is they actually will tag into that aquifer and actually clean the water. so that it becomes usable. Have you heard about this process?

Speaker 12 [11:45:15 AM]
I have just, just a bit.

Speaker 11 [11:45:18 AM]
And, and your take on

Speaker 2 [11:45:19 AM]
it

Speaker 12 [11:45:20 AM]
Well, I think, I think it's, it's consistent, Mr. Chair, with, with the conversation I had with, with uh Chairman Westerman that America seems to find a way at every turn. And so that's just the next example. I, I don't pretend to have an idea of what the, the next technologies will be, but as I said, I wouldn't, I wouldn't bet bet against something that's pretty powerful and, and, uh, and, and something that would really enable us to achieve great things.

Speaker 11 [11:45:50 AM]
And uh we're gonna need less energy, right? in the future?

Speaker 2 [11:45:55 AM]
No,

Speaker 12 [11:45:55 AM]
sir.

Speaker 11 [11:45:55 AM]
We I need Loa, right?

Speaker 12 [11:45:57 AM]
That the projections are

Speaker 11 [11:45:58 AM]
Dadisons are going all over my my district Ontario 3, and we need lots of it. So we're gonna need all hands on above. um, you're familiar with, uh,

Speaker 2 [11:46:10 AM]
um

Speaker 11 [11:46:13 AM]
change tack

Speaker 2 [11:46:13 AM]
here

Speaker 11 [11:46:14 AM]
Um coal.

Speaker 12 [11:46:19 AM]
The

Speaker 11 [11:46:19 AM]
scrubbers and everything, uh, was it getting really any uh particulates into the air. You know what, it's pretty darn clean when you,

Speaker 12 [11:46:27 AM]
it's remarkably clean. That's, that's a point that I'm glad you mentioned because it's something that's often neglected. Not only is

Speaker 2 [11:46:34 AM]
Cole

Speaker 12 [11:46:35 AM]
here in the United States, much cleaner naturally. than coal that's produced in other parts of the world. I, I, it, it doesn't get enough attention, but that's the reality.

Speaker 11 [11:46:44 AM]
The,

Speaker 12 [11:46:45 AM]
the next point that you make is, is, is maybe even more powerful, and that's that the technological advances in burning coal, make it incredibly clean. And, and so there, so there's, there's no downside, in other words, in my view,

Speaker 2 [11:46:59 AM]
right. Uh,

Speaker 11 [11:47:01 AM]
now the question I had was, uh, to the gentleman who was asking you from Rhode Island. I think it's pretty specific what you're looking for is that under the Biden administration, there were a lot of lacks. uh interpretations of the law say it that way. So it seems to me that the whole process is under review, is it not?

Speaker 12 [11:47:19 AM]
Yes, sir.

Speaker 11 [11:47:20 AM]
So that's pretty specific, isn't it? It

Speaker 12 [11:47:22 AM]
is. And, and if I might, Mr. Chair, mention, mention one thing that I also think speaks for itself, but acting solicitor Zerzan reinstated a M opinion that Mr. Georgiani uh instituted from the first Trump administration. He acting solicitor Greg Zerzan did that on May 1st. That's a document that also, in my view, speaks for itself, and I believe in line with your question is worth attention.

Speaker 11 [11:47:52 AM]
Well then we don't know actually who was monitoring the pen,

Speaker 2 [11:47:56 AM]
right? That's right.

Speaker 11 [11:47:58 AM]
So, it could have been anybody OKing to this stuff.

Speaker 12 [11:48:03 AM]
Potentially so, I was not there, correct.

Speaker 11 [11:48:06 AM]
Well, thank you, Mr. Sis, I see no more people on the dais, and with that, we'll let you go and we'll set up our pal too. Thank you so very much, Mr. Sis.

Speaker 12 [11:48:14 AM]
Thank you for having me.

Speaker 11 [11:48:41 AM]
Now, uh, while the clerk resets our two witness table, I will remind the witnesses that under committee rules they must limit their oral statements to 5 minutes, but their entire statement will be made public in the record. Um, we use lights here, so when you see the green light, you're go yellow, you start slowing down and give me the red light, you gotta stop. I think that goes without doubt. And please remember to hit your microphone so we can all hear you.

Speaker 2 [11:49:16 AM]
first Yeah. I mean, depending on when you start, you have 2 minutes. testimony. Yeah.

Speaker 11 [11:49:39 AM]
As with the second panel, I will allow all witnesses to testify before member questioning. Our first witness is Mr. Hans Schmidt, who is the president CEO of Ocean Minerals LLC. He is stationed in Houston, Texas. Mr. Schmidt, you are now recognized for 5 minutes.

Speaker 9 [11:50:00 AM]
Chairman, ranking member Ansari and members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today. My name is Hans Schmidt, and I serve as the CEO

Speaker 12 [11:50:09 AM]
of

Speaker 11 [11:50:10 AM]
your button.

Speaker 2 [11:50:11 AM]
Sorry,

Speaker 11 [11:50:12 AM]
uh,

Speaker 9 [11:50:14 AM]
I just got to get a

Speaker 2 [11:50:15 AM]
little closer.

Speaker 9 [11:50:16 AM]
My name is Hans Schmidt and I serve as the CEO of uh

Speaker 18 [11:50:20 AM]
Ocean Minerals and the wholly owned subsidiary company, Mohanna Minerals. I commend the committee for advancing HR 1418 and for recognizing the urgent need to assert American leadership in the race for critical minerals. Last month during the Cook Island's 60th anniversary of self-governance. US officials, including White House National Security Council senior Director David Copley and Department of Commerce Deputy Assistant Secretary Joshua Croon. joined the celebrations and announced a joint statement on US Cook Island's cooperation on seabed Mineral Resources. This underscores America's commitment to responsible development in the Pacific. In addition, NOWA is prepared to send a research team into the region to expand the baseline data collection, further advancing our scientific understanding of the seabed

Speaker 2 [11:51:10 AM]
environment.

Speaker 18 [11:51:11 AM]
Ocean minerals traces its origins to a US Army research laboratory initiative following China's 2011 Rare earth export restrictions. That research identified polymetallic nodules in the Cook Islands exclusive economic zone, as amongst some of the most resource rich and geopolitical favorable critical mineral deposits in the world. Within our 23,600 square kilometer license area. Mahana Minerals has identified polymetallic nodules containing more than 80 million tons of manganese, 2.5 million tons of cobalt, 1.4 million tons a nickel, 750,000 tons of copper and significant amounts of rare earth elements. These nodules lie unattached on the seafloor service, accessible without excavation, offering a far less compli complicated extraction method. Today, China controls 87% of the rare earth refining, 60% of nickel processing and the majority of cobalt production. This dominance is not simply economic, it's strategic. The United States must secure allied sourced alternatives to safeguard our industrial base energy grid and national defense. President Trump's April 2025 executive order unleashing America's offshore critical minerals and resources recognizes seabed minerals and as an essential US strategy, HR 1418 builds on this by authorizing engagement in deep sea exploration and development, prioritizing US aligned jurisdictions and companies. Our project directly supports this policy framework. Ocean Minerals is a US controled company operating in the Cook Islands under the 2024 Seabed Monroe regulations, which are some of the most stringent in the world. We are advancing both resource development and environmental stewardship. Our operations are undergoing a full environmental and social impact assessment with oversight from the Cook Islands government and active engagement with civil society. Financially, a single ocean's mineral production vessel is projected to generate 1.4 billion in annual revenue with pre-tax IRR of 36% and an NPV exceeding 4.7 billion. These economics are backed by our pri prior proprietary US developed metallurgical technology, currently moving from laboratory validation towards pilot

Speaker 2 [11:53:34 AM]
scale.

Speaker 18 [11:53:36 AM]
We are also working to build the first commercial grade deep sea mining vessel and established the first US-based refining for processing seabed resources. This would secure not only upstream supply, but also importantly downstream industrial capability. A full ecosystem that reduces US dependence on underlying supplies across the value chain. Let me emphasize, deep sea development can and must be done responsibly. Nodules can be collected from the seaboard surface with minimal impact to the environment. We are designing systems to reduce sediment impact and investigating in marine research partnerships, investing in marine research partnerships to ensure the best practices. The Cook Islands government, NOA and US agencies can help ensure that this development gets global, get sets a global standard for transparency and sustainability. HR 144018 comes at a pivotal moment. It would provide strategic clarity and support for offshore resource

Speaker 2 [11:54:37 AM]
projects,

Speaker 18 [11:54:38 AM]
encourage cooperation with allied nations including Pacific Islands. Leverage America's technological advantage and US controlled companies to strengthen the supply chain security. Chairman and members, these seabed resources are a critical part of the solution to securing our critical mineral supply chain. The question is whether the United States will lead or whether we will cede this ground to strategic competitors. Ocean Minerals stands by stands ready to demonstrate how American innovation and allied partnerships can responsibly secure the minerals that power our economy, our energy transition, and our national defense. We urge you to support HR 1418, and thank you for the opportunity to

Speaker 2 [11:55:21 AM]
testify.

Speaker 11 [11:55:22 AM]
Thank you, Mr. Schmidt. Our next witness is Mr. Travis Deti. who is the executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association and is stationed in Cheyenne, Wyoming. Mr. D T 5 minutes. Thank you.

Speaker 5 [11:55:35 AM]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, uh, ranking member Ansari. Uh, my name is Travis Deai. I am the executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association, and I, uh, really appreciate the kind invitation to join you here today to crawl out from under my rock in Wyoming and, and uh get out here to, to talk about a couple of, uh, pretty important bills for us. uh, uh, specifically HR 280 and HR. 4068. So, uh, the Wyoming Mining Association, where the statewide trade association in Wyoming, uh, representing 34 mining companies producing bentonite, coal, trona, which is our natural soda ash industry, uranium and lignite, as well as companies developing gold, copper, lithium, and two significant rare earths deposits as well. We also represent more than 100 associate member companies and one electrical co op and two advanced nuclear power companies. We've been the leading coal-producing state since 19 86 as Representative Hagegeman alluded to, uh, recent estimates give Wyoming more than 165 billion tons of economically recoverable coal with over 1.4 trillion tons in total coal reserves. Our reserve is massive. Electrical power is by far our largest coal consumer, and Wyoming produces about 40% of the nation's thermal coal. With coal providing for between 18 and 23% of America's electricity generation at any given time. Wyoming Coal provides between 7.5% and 9.2% of the nation's electricity. The coal industry is critical for Wyoming, employing 4300 men and women with an average cold uh uh wage of about $102,000 per year. That, uh, that wage is well above the state average. Every coal mining job supports another 2 to 3 jobs in the service and supply industry. The BLM Federal Coal Leasing Program, which allows companies to lease and mine on federal land has been a remarkable success for Wyoming. The annual financial contribution of coal mining to the state of Wyoming and local governments in the form of taxes, royalties, and fees is estimated at $600 million a year. Uh, last year, Wyoming's Sheriff Federal Mineral royalties was over $170 million and in a town where you talk in trillions, uh, you know, 170 million, that that means that's real money in Wyoming. The revenue has been dedicated to building schools, supporting community colleges and highways and keeping the tax burden low on Wyoming citizens. For over 3 decades, bonus bids from the federal co-leasing program have totaled over $2.6 billion and these funds have gone directly to build schools and school facilities in every county in Wyoming. The impact the industry, uh, and the coal leasing program has is simply huge. Uh, we're talking real jobs, real revenue, and we're talking real people. And when you think about uh the, the purpose of, of, of the coal leasing program to get a public benefit and to make sure the American taxpayer is getting their, their bang for their buck, uh, you know, we, we are, and the uh and the idea that we're getting shortchanged by the program, which was the main reason the moratorium was put in place in the first, in the first place under the Obama administration, it's simply false. Wyoming mines are among the safest, most productive, and most environmentally responsible surface mines globally. Mine reclamation is ongoing and takes place simultaneously with mining activities, and it starts before the first shovel of earth is even turned. With the projected demand uh from a DOE study from the last couple of months ago, uh, of 35 to 50% increase in American electricity needs by 2024. Uh, we are in a spot, uh, due to, uh, you, you know, our, our, our, our ability to provide electricity for growing artificial intelligence, data centers, manufacturing, general electrification, electric vehicles. We're going to need a lot more power than we currently generate right now. Um, and we're going to need coal. We're going to need coal. We're gonna need gas. We're gonna need nuclear, and we cannot rely on intermittent sources of power. So coal is going to remain in the mix. Uh, we don't have enough coal east right now. The general, uh, uh, uh lack of leasing activity in the past 15 years, has left us in a spot we have about 3.2 billion tons of coal under lease right now. Not all of that is recoverable. Uh, but when you look at projected demand and what we're going to need in the future, we simply don't have enough. Uh, so we need to make the coal resource available and with regards to uh looking at uh, at the NEPA process and ways to streamline, uh, so that we can get more leases on the table and get more coal leased, uh, anything that we can do, uh, uh, anything that we can do to help that is, is appreciated. So, offering support for both of the bills that I was called here to talk to today. And again, appreciate the invitation and I look forward to the conversation, and I thank you Mr. Chairman

Speaker 1 [12:00:38 PM]
Thank you for your testimony. Our next witness is Dr. Steve Feldegas, who is a former principal deputy Assistant Secretary, Land and Minerals at the US Department of the Interior. and a station here in Washington DC Doctor Felgus, you now have recognized for five

Speaker 2 [12:00:52 PM]
minutes.

Speaker 17 [12:00:53 PM]
Thank you very much, Chairman Sauer, ranking member Ansari. I appreciate the invitation to testify before you today. My name is Steve Felgus, and I recently served as the principal deputy Assistant Secretary

Speaker 15 [12:01:03 PM]
for Land and Minerals Management at the Department of the Interior, where I oversaw the Bureau of Land Management and helped to lead the

Speaker 17 [12:01:09 PM]
interagency working group on mineral laws, regulations and permitting.

Speaker 2 [12:01:13 PM]
Now, a number of the bills before us today share a common presence, uh premise.

Speaker 17 [12:01:18 PM]
And that is that if you cut the public

Speaker 15 [12:01:19 PM]
out and force projects through faster, that development will accelerate. But my experience tells a different story. because that strategy backfires. It creates longer

Speaker 17 [12:01:29 PM]
delays, costlier litigation and fewer successful projects.

Speaker 2 [12:01:34 PM]
Projects

Speaker 17 [12:01:35 PM]
don't succeed because we add more shortcuts to the

Speaker 2 [12:01:37 PM]
process.

Speaker 17 [12:01:38 PM]
They succeed because the agencies doing the permitting have the resources they need to do the job properly. And they succeed because they earn community trust and

Speaker 2 [12:01:47 PM]
support.

Speaker 17 [12:01:48 PM]
Let me explain why with a simple

Speaker 2 [12:01:50 PM]
truth.

Speaker 17 [12:01:51 PM]
Environmental reviews are not what are slowing mining projects down Community opposition is. When we eliminate opportunities to address opposition constructively. We don't eliminate that opposition. We simply force it into courtrooms, where it takes longer to resolve and creates lasting mistrust.

Speaker 2 [12:02:09 PM]
Instead,

Speaker 17 [12:02:10 PM]
had communities been brought in earlier from the beginning of the project, they might have become ardent supporters of that project. So we take potential collaboration, and we turn it into confrontation. And instead of partners, we create plaintiffs. Consider Montana's Sabani Stillwater mine. In the mid-1990s, that company faced angry residents, threatening lawsuits over the development of that project. Now rather than fighting through that opposition, the company chose to engage. And they developed a good neighbor agreement that was signed with the potential opponents in 2000. And the result of that was, according to the company, reduced permitting delays and largely eliminating concerns about transparency. And in the 24 years since, there's been no arbitration and no environmental litigation around that

Speaker 2 [12:02:58 PM]
project.

Speaker 17 [12:02:59 PM]
So this isn't just good policy, it's good business. The International Council on Mining and Metals, which represents 26 of the world's largest mining companies, understands this. Their CEO calls trust between mining companies and local communities, quote, the industries's most valuable commodity. not gold, not platinum, not lithium, but

Speaker 2 [12:03:19 PM]
trust.

Speaker 17 [12:03:20 PM]
When industry leaders themselves say trust is their most valuable asset. Why should we shortcut the very processes that build that trust. Now let me talk about Nipah for a moment, because I think there's a lot of discussion about what Nipah really is for people on the ground. And the fact is, Nipah is about listening. It's about making sure that people are heard, and often it's the only chance that anyone has to weigh in on projects that are going to impact their

Speaker 2 [12:03:48 PM]
lives.

Speaker 17 [12:03:50 PM]
If someone wants

Speaker 15 [12:03:50 PM]
to build something that's going to affect their water or their air, or where their children are playing, Nipah says

Speaker 17 [12:03:57 PM]
you get to speak up. You get to ask questions and you get to be part of that conversation. And what the data actually shows is that Nipah is not slowing projects

Speaker 2 [12:04:07 PM]
down.

Speaker 17 [12:04:08 PM]
And under the Biden administration, BLM approved at least 49 mines. I think the numbers actually closer to 55 by the time we left office. 36 of those were brand new

Speaker 2 [12:04:19 PM]
mines.

Speaker 17 [12:04:20 PM]
And in Nevada, we were able to get from the notice of intent to a record of decision in under 2 years on average, which is faster than almost anywhere else in the world.

Speaker 15 [12:04:30 PM]
Now, the global average

Speaker 17 [12:04:32 PM]
for the whole process going from discovery to production. This number gets thrown around a lot. Currently, it's being reported that the US takes 19 years, just barely over the international average of 17, and only 10 months slower than Canada, and also faster than a lot of

Speaker 2 [12:04:48 PM]
countries. So the choice

Speaker 17 [12:04:50 PM]
before us isn't between speed and community engagement. It's between short-term expediency and long-term

Speaker 2 [12:04:58 PM]
success.

Speaker 17 [12:04:59 PM]
By silencing communities and shortcutting essential processes, these bills might produce permits

Speaker 11 [12:05:04 PM]
faster.

Speaker 17 [12:05:05 PM]
but they'll produce projects that face greater opposition, more legal challenges, and ultimately longer delays. True mineral security requires genuine community partnership. It requires the patience to prioritize sustainable development over short term extracting

Speaker 2 [12:05:22 PM]
targets.

Speaker 17 [12:05:23 PM]
And most fundamentally successful mineral development depends on community

Speaker 2 [12:05:27 PM]
trust. The

Speaker 17 [12:05:29 PM]
bills before us, some of the bills before us ignore that reality and double down on an approach that prioritizes confrontation over collaboration. But the evidence is clear from successful mining operations from industry leaders and from federal land management expertise. We need a fundamentally different approach. So I urge this committee to pursue policies that build genuine partnerships with the communities that will host these critical projects. Because faster permitting isn't just about cutting steps. It's about building trust so projects can actually move forward. The path to mental security runs through community trust and long term thinking, not through shortcuts that create more problems than they solve. Thank you very

Speaker 2 [12:06:09 PM]
much.

Speaker 1 [12:06:10 PM]
Uh, thank you very much for your testimony. Our last witness is, uh, Ms. Deborah Strushacker. She is a mining and public lands policy consultant and the co-founder of the Women's excuse me, of the Women's Mining Coalition and is stationed in Reno, Nevada. Uh, Mr. Sacker, you are now recognized for your 5 minutes.

Speaker 14 [12:06:30 PM]
Thank you, Chairman Sauer, Ranking Merandsari and members of the committee on behalf of the Women's Mining Coalition, I really appreciate this opportunity to testify today. Three decades of unfavorable policies have discouraged private sector investment in US minerals exploration and development.

Speaker 13 [12:06:50 PM]
and have hollowed out the mining sector.

Speaker 14 [12:06:54 PM]
Today's minerals emergency is a direct result of neglecting the importance of maintaining a strong domestic mining industry capable of providing essential minerals. President Trump's minerals executive orders and several of the bills being heard today will eliminate some of the barriers to domestic minerals exploration and mine development that have caused the minerals emergency. These barriers include

Speaker 2 [12:07:22 PM]
the costly,

Speaker 14 [12:07:23 PM]
lengthy, and litigious permitting process.

Speaker 6 [12:07:27 PM]
Over

Speaker 14 [12:07:27 PM]
30 years of legislative threats to radically amend the US mining law, and the Ninth Circuit Courts flawed 2022, mining law ruling in the Rosemont case. both of which seek to eliminate the security of land tenure that is the hallmark of the mining law. Land withdrawals that have put millions of acres of potentially mineralized lands off limits. Regulations and land use plans that restrict minerals activities. and the thirty-year absence of federal mining and mineral processing R&D resulting from Congress's decision in 1995 to stop funding the US Bureau of Mines. HR 40903872 and 1366 take important steps to reduce these barriers and to respond to the minerals emergency. HR 4090 codifies directives in President Trump's executive orders to remove roadblocks to mineral exploration and development on federal lands by identifying laws and regulations that impede mineral activities and that need to be revised or revoked. HR 3872 adds hard rock minerals to the minerals Leasing Act for acquired lands. The nation's 64 million acres of acquired lands are severely underexplored. In 2018, only a minuscule 50,000 acres thatched roughly 0.08% of acquired lands were being explored and developed, and most of that work was being done in Missouri. Congress should consider making acquired lands subject to the mining laws self-executing claims system in order to facilitate exploration and development. HR 1366 would reduce the problems stemming from the Rosemont court's misinterpretation of the mining

Speaker 2 [12:09:37 PM]
law.

Speaker 14 [12:09:39 PM]
This bill authorizes a new kind of mill site that can be co-located coterminously with mining claims and uh on mining claims, and it can be located these new mill sites can be located on mineralized or unmineralized lands within a plan of

Speaker 2 [12:09:56 PM]
operations.

Speaker 14 [12:09:58 PM]
HR 1366 also creates a long-awaited and much-needed abandoned hard rock mine fund that would use the annual claims maintenance fees that would be paid for this new kind of mill site. In response to the mining law directive that is in executive order 14241 and to Rosemont we suggest that HR 4,904,090 be expanded to explicitly confirm that the mining law guarantees secure land tenure and authorizes putting mind support facilities on public lands open to mineral entry regardless of their mineral character. because the mining law leverages private sector investment to discover and develop minerals, it will play an essential role in solving the minerals emergency. The map baby map directive in HR 4090 will use modern mapping techniques to find hidden mineral deposits that are buried beneath unmineralized rocks, but mapping is just the

Speaker 2 [12:11:06 PM]
beginning.

Speaker 14 [12:11:08 PM]
Exploring for hidden minerals requires multi-million dollar drilling programs to identify economically viable mineral deposits, permitting exploration needs to be accelerated by streamlining approvals for projects that disturb fewer than 20 acres, and by developing a permit by rule or categorical exclusion for larger, more advanced exploration projects, expediting exploration is a key to increas ing minerals production Mineral processing R&D is required to solve the metallurgical challenges associated with economically recovering byproduct critical minerals from mine tailings. Congress thus needs to restore the federal mining and metallurgical R&D capabilities that were lost with the demise of the US Bureau of Mines. Recognizing that mineral security is national security. The Women's Mining Coalition applauds Chairman Sauer, Mr. Fallon, and Mister Amaday for their leadership in introducing these bills to help restore America to its rightful place as the world's leading producer of minerals. Uh, we thank you again for this opportunity to testify, and we're I'd be happy to answer any of your questions.

Speaker 1 [12:12:30 PM]
Thank you very much for your testimony. The chair will now recognize members for 5 minutes of questions, and I will be recognizing myself for 5 minutes.

Speaker 2 [12:12:43 PM]
What's that? I do craig first

Speaker 1 [12:12:46 PM]
Oh, Mr. Crank, uh, I'm gonna give you the first uh shot at the 5 minutes. I apologize. You're, you

Speaker 8 [12:12:52 PM]
are very kind, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. I appreciate that. Uh. thank you all for your testimony. China currently holds the

Speaker 2 [12:13:00 PM]
most

Speaker 8 [12:13:01 PM]
exploratory leases issued by the International Seabed Authority. Of the 22 exploratory leases granted for 15-year terms. China holds 5, the most of any country, while Russia holds 2, and that means that nearly 30% of current exploration leases are controlled by our adversaries.

Speaker 2 [12:13:23 PM]
Meanwhile,

Speaker 8 [12:13:23 PM]
the United States is already heavily reliant on China for the extraction, processing and refining of critical minerals. According to the US Geological Survey's 2025 Mineral Commodities report. The United States is more than 50% net import reliant for non-fuel mineral commodities, and China is the largest supplier providing 21 minerals To reduce our dependence on foreign adversaries. The Trump administration has committed to restarting domestic mining and cutting back regulatory burdens that have effectively shut down hard rock mining in the

Speaker 2 [12:14:01 PM]
US.

Speaker 8 [12:14:03 PM]
Giving that uh polymetallic nodules on the ocean floor contain high concentrations of key critical minerals, we must consider offshore extraction as part of a comprehensive strategy to reduce reliance on China. Mr.

Speaker 2 [12:14:20 PM]
Smith

Speaker 8 [12:14:22 PM]
Given China's significant share of deep sea mining leases. In your expert opinion, how capable are they, excuse me, of securing extraction

Speaker 2 [12:14:31 PM]
leases

Speaker 8 [12:14:32 PM]
from the International Seabed Authority, and what steps should the US take to stay ahead.

Speaker 9 [12:14:40 PM]
Uh, the,

Speaker 18 [12:14:41 PM]
the Chinese have a very clear plan with regards to developing their um underwater mining technologies, um, and developing that industry as they have done, um, with terrestrial deposits. Uh, there's an instance of them taking all the different agencies that were dispersed across China and consolidating them into a centralized location at a port city. uh, and giving them the directive to develop this technology and to put this into being. Uh, and we know that on the extractive side, they've already built equipment. They've tested equipment, not at full ocean depth yet, but getting there. Uh, on the metallurgical side, they've done extensive work on, uh, extracting of metals out of the polymetallic nodules. Uh, and what we see is a government-led and government-driven, um, initiative pushing industry through um selective aid to get this technology and this industry off the ground. And following through on that, they will be successful, um, to get to where they want to be. That is, that is what they are determined to do and, and we believe they will get there. Consequently, uh, for the

Speaker 2 [12:15:56 PM]
US

Speaker 18 [12:15:57 PM]
yeah, it's, we find this to be a very interesting situation. The technology and the ability for the US and the US partners, uh, to, uh, to counter this is very strong. The technology and the ability of the US exists with this technology. In fact, the first instances of deep sea mining technology were built and and proven in the 1970s by US companies. Uh, and the US currently leads in that field. What we are seeing though is that what we lack is the same um, thrust and push from the government and the support to make sure that the US take this lead that we currently have with technology and what we've proven and turn it into, uh, an industry that we can rely on through mining not only our domestic, uh, resources, but also aligning with uh selective and aligned partners to be, to be able to bring this to the market.

Speaker 8 [12:16:52 PM]
And, and, and, and Mr. Smith, I serve also on the House Armed Services Committee, you know, China recognizes the United States as its main adversary. There's times I sit on this committee, and, and by the way, China uses everything to them is about defense. Here we don't seem to, to, to look at it that way. Um, we should, and we need to, um, but, but we're not as, as good, uh, as at that as China is, unfortunately, we need to get better,

Speaker 2 [12:17:22 PM]
uh,

Speaker 8 [12:17:23 PM]
Mr. Dee, in our previous panel with Assistant Secretary C. I raised Colorado's plan to retire all of its coal-fired power plants by 2031, and I have a lot of concerns about that. Uh, your testimony highlights future local, uh, future load growth, I'm sorry, and the need for additional generation on our nation's grid. Do you believe Colorado's forced closure of coal-fired power plants will impact consumers' access to reliable energy as electricity demands continue to grow.

Speaker 2 [12:17:54 PM]
Uh, congressman, yes.

Speaker 5 [12:17:56 PM]
absolutely. Um, as I, as I stated in my, in my testimony, uh, we need, we need more energy, uh, based on projected demand, not less. We need to reliable, dispatchable energy. We need coal, we need gas, we need nuclear. We, what we really need in this country, and we're kind of seeing it actually, and it's very refreshing to see in all that works strategy as opposed to an all of the above strategy, and what works is coal, oil, uh, coal, gas, and, and nuclear. And uh you know, when you talk about uh uh affordability, uh, you know, one of the reasons why electricity generation, you can look at the correlation of coal coming off the grid, renewables coming on the grid, and energy prices rise, and it's largely because uh of the uh the unreliability and the uh inter intermittent power that you have to use a backup and and those coal plants and those gas plants weren't meant to ramp up and wrap down. They were meant to run at 95% capacity all the time, so that when you turn your lights on the lights come on. And we're seeing in this country in large major cities across the country that have gotten accustomed to rolling brownouts, uh, because the because the uh the supply just does not meet the demand, and, um, you know what, that's third world stuff right there, Congressman, and uh and we need to keep your, we need to keep your coal plants online.

Speaker 8 [12:19:16 PM]
Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you for your indulgence. Appreciate

Speaker 2 [12:19:20 PM]
it.

Speaker 1 [12:19:20 PM]
Uh, we have, uh, Representative Dingell up from the great state of Michigan.

Speaker 2 [12:19:26 PM]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward

Speaker 6 [12:19:29 PM]
to any bipartisan effort this committee makes to lower the cost to everyday

Speaker 2 [12:19:34 PM]
Americans.

Speaker 6 [12:19:35 PM]
However, I have a few concerns with some of the legislation in front of us today,

Speaker 2 [12:19:40 PM]
and

Speaker 14 [12:19:41 PM]
I don't believe it's gonna reduce the cost for some of these pieces, I don't believe will reduce any costs for

Speaker 2 [12:19:46 PM]
Americans.

Speaker 14 [12:19:48 PM]
HR 4068, the streamlining Nipah for Kolle directs the Secretary of the Interior to identify existing and potential categorical exclusions to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA as we call it, for to further the production and export the

Speaker 2 [12:20:07 PM]
coal.

Speaker 14 [12:20:09 PM]
Instead of considering ways to reduce Americans' energy costs. We are considering language to find ways to weaken Nipah for the benefit of foreign

Speaker 6 [12:20:17 PM]
countries like China.

Speaker 2 [12:20:20 PM]
I know my

Speaker 6 [12:20:21 PM]
colleagues across the aisle are worried about it, and you talk about more and more how they're building more coal plants,

Speaker 2 [12:20:28 PM]
but

Speaker 6 [12:20:29 PM]
is it really what we want to do to remove our bedrock environmental laws to help meet China's growing demand.

Speaker 2 [12:20:36 PM]
Look, I'm gonna be honest, I admit it.

Speaker 6 [12:20:39 PM]
I was married to John Dingell, the man who I loved with my whole heart and soul, and he heart worked hard to get mepah passed

Speaker 2 [12:20:46 PM]
and signed into law. And uh

Speaker 6 [12:20:51 PM]
we, well, I'll talk about that in a minute, but what Nipah requires is federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of their proposed actions before making decisions. Today, it continues to be one of the nation's strongest tools in ensuring that communities across the country have meaningful input on major federal actions.

Speaker 19 [12:21:12 PM]
Nipah's basic policy, and by the way, it's around the world, it's considered the Magna Carta of, I mean, other countries talk about it. Nipah's basic policy is to ensure that all branches of government, including the judiciary, give proper consideration to the impacts of project will have on the environment before any federal action is taken.

Speaker 2 [12:21:36 PM]
Gaining

Speaker 19 [12:21:36 PM]
access to the courts has always been an integral component of compliance with Nipah. Local communities and stakeholders should have the ability to have a strong voice through filing legal challenges when they fear a project is not in compliance with NEPA And look, right now I've got a community that is up in arms. It's taking radioactive waste that it doesn't want. It's near water, and by the way, it's not federal law, it's state law that doesn't allow community input to be taken into account on the permitting and this community is on fire. They're on fire against all of us. And state law needs to be changed on that, but I've seen why community input

Speaker 2 [12:22:18 PM]
matters.

Speaker 19 [12:22:19 PM]
So I, if that may clear up my hearings with all of you, my the chair knows I want to work with Republicans on a bipartisan permitting reform efforts, but we must ensure it's done in a way that protects our climate and our environment and our nation's own long-term benefit and communities should have been put. We don't want it, but it's smart witness that I'm about to ask a question,

Speaker 2 [12:22:45 PM]
said,

Speaker 19 [12:22:46 PM]
it isn't slowing down all the projects people think. The Mr. Falus, I have a question on Nicole. Is the US domes domestic demand for coal growing or

Speaker 2 [12:22:56 PM]
shrinking?

Speaker 17 [12:22:57 PM]
Certainly since, well, over the past nearly 20 years, it's been

Speaker 2 [12:23:00 PM]
shrinking.

Speaker 19 [12:23:01 PM]
And which country is leading the global demand for coal and we'll be searching for further import opportunities for coal.

Speaker 17 [12:23:09 PM]
My understanding is that's

Speaker 2 [12:23:10 PM]
China.

Speaker 19 [12:23:11 PM]
And finally, will increasing coal production for foreign export lead to lower energy costs for Americans?

Speaker 17 [12:23:18 PM]
I would not expect so, no.

Speaker 19 [12:23:21 PM]
So I just want to say to my colleagues, increasing the United States' exports of coal at the expense of our environment will not lead to lowering costs for everyday Americans. So I'm going to urge my colleagues to expose this and as I've said before, I want to work with the chairman on minerals because it is a very real issue. And with that, I will yield back.

Speaker 1 [12:23:41 PM]
Thank you very much. I'm gonna ask you unanimous consent that the following letter from the National Mining Association expressing support for HR 1366. HR 280, HR 4068, and HR 4090 be entered into the record. Without objection, so ordered. Next up is uh Sheriff Ezel from Mississippi for 5 minutes. Sheriff,

Speaker 12 [12:24:02 PM]
thank

Speaker 2 [12:24:02 PM]
you, Chief.

Speaker 5 [12:24:03 PM]
Mr. Schmidt, uh, securing the supply chain for critical minerals is a top priority for the Trump administration. As you know, this committee is working on several pieces of legislation. to help advance those goals. My bill HR 4018 specifically crafted to help advance deep sea mining by codifying portions of President Trump's executive order 14285.

Speaker 2 [12:24:29 PM]
We

Speaker 5 [12:24:30 PM]
believe that deep sea mining could provide an incredible new opportunity for the United States to produce additional critical minerals needed for many sectors of our economy, including technology, defense, and energy.

Speaker 2 [12:24:43 PM]
What are your thoughts on the potential, uh, deep sea mining has to

Speaker 5 [12:24:47 PM]
help the United States meet its critical mineral

Speaker 2 [12:24:50 PM]
needs. Congressman, uh,

Speaker 18 [12:24:54 PM]
our view is that in order to meet the uh, the demands of critical metals in the United States, uh, deep sea mining is is an essential part of that. Uh, this combined with all the other mining that is occurring, uh, is essential to, to meet that demand. And I think the other thing that it also does is, is breaks down uh the reliance on non-aligned partners. Uh, the, the, the bull goes, uh, directs various agencies to um ensure that the, the support needed for this industry to develop using the American technology lead that we have and to bring this industry into being resulting in not only technological vessels and processing facilities that are sourced in the US and would be domiciled in the US, um, which I, you know, create incredible, uh, industry opportunities while supplying these metals, uh, it also goes further by ensuring that, uh, there's alignment with, uh, with partners where these metals can be sourced. I think one of the realities we have to face is that a lot of the metals that the US needs, um, are not readily available in US territories and therefore alignment with uh with with strategic partners is important and particularly partners aligned with the American goals and, and visions. So I think this bull, without this bull, it was a struggle. It was a struggle getting the attention of people. It was a struggle getting people focused, um, and agencies focused on what is needed to get this done. Uh, and this bill goes a very long way to, uh, to making sure that, um, when the industry comes to the government to help grow this the sector and to bring it into production so we can answer these demands, uh, we get the attention, the support, and the guidance necessary.

Speaker 2 [12:26:48 PM]
Very good.

Speaker 5 [12:26:49 PM]
What role does China currently play in deep sea mining sector. How do American capabilities compare with what you know of the

Speaker 2 [12:26:57 PM]
Chinese.

Speaker 18 [12:26:59 PM]
So the Chinese, um, currently, um, have a fairly strong influence within the international Seabed Authority, um, um, as mentioned before, uh, they hold a number of exploration licenses and are very active, uh, within that, uh, community. Uh, in addition to that, the Chinese government has clearly stated that the industry needs to build the technology and the equipment, uh, to, to bring this into being. Uh, and the Chinese are actively looking for, uh, resources. So they are looking for deposits that are currently um uh undeveloped and are looking to secure those. Uh, and I think that is a, a, a, an important initiative if you look at the histories of how China has secured the raw supply and through that developed an extractive and refining, uh, industry that they now dominate. And I think what needs to happen and under the bill is that America needs to step into that position as well, where we not only go out and secure the raw materials We use that as a mechanism for, uh, building as the foundation for building this industry and building all the technologies and developments that we need here in the

Speaker 2 [12:28:15 PM]
US.

Speaker 5 [12:28:16 PM]
What does the US need to do to establish and expand our lead in this sector.

Speaker 1 [12:28:22 PM]
The, the industry is, is a nascent industry, um, and it is not yet at the point, um, where the traditional capital markets and the funding mechanisms that, uh, traditional mining projects, uh, used to get into production are available to us. So because of the strategic nature of what we're doing and the stage at which we find ourselves. This is a great opportunity for the US government to step in as an industry development partner and help bridge that gap from where we currently find ourselves to the point that we have bankable, uh, projects that traditional financing and traditional, uh, methods of running this, this sector, um, can take place. Were this a part of an existing industry, that would not be needed. Uh, but this is new. Um, and it is critical and it's essential for going forward. So I think it warrants that type of initiative and effort.

Speaker 2 [12:29:18 PM]
Thank you, sir. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

Speaker 3 [12:29:21 PM]
Thank you very much, uh, um, I'm gonna ask you unanimous unanimous consent once again, uh, that the following November 2023 article from the US Energy Information Administration, highlighting the importance of US coal exports to Europe, and countering Russia in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. He entered into the record. Without objection, so ordered. Uh, next up is uh ranking member Ansari for 5 minutes.

Speaker 5 [12:29:47 PM]
Thank you, Chair stopper. Doctor Felis, welcome back to the committee. I appreciate your testimony on proven ways to improve mining permitting. Arizona, the state that I represent, is a mining state. We've seen the benefits, the industry, the jobs, and also the challenges in ensuring that we protect the environment, preserve our scarce water supplies and address community concerns. Doctor Felis, during the last administration, you worked on the report for the interagency working group report on mining law reform, which brought together industry, tribes, communities, and other stakeholders. Could you please elaborate on the best practices for improving permitting timelines and reducing litigation.

Speaker 4 [12:30:31 PM]
Sure thing. Thank you for the question, Congresswoman. Uh early engagement, early and meaningful engagement with the communities and tribal nations that are going to be impacted by any particular mining project is probably the number one best practice that can help to, um, you know, make projects go a lot smoother. It helps to address any concerns that the community has. It also helps to uh the mining company to incorporate the concerns as early as possible in the process. So before the detailed engineering, before, you know, a lot of the work to get the financing starts. They can begin to address the concerns whether it's about water sources or particular sacred spaces that, um, could get impacted. And so I think it's a, it's a win-win for the community and the industry to start as early as possible.

Speaker 5 [12:31:19 PM]
Thank you. Um, there are ways to make sure America can access the critical minerals we need while ensuring that tribes and local communities are respected and see the benefits of the mines in their backyards. From what I'm hearing today, that's a shared goal, but unfortunately it's not really what we're seeing play out under this administration. For just one example, just this June, EXIM, the export import Bank loaned a gold mine in Nevada, $50 million in taxpayer dollars. I'm not opposed to federal support for industries that will truly be beneficial for the American people, but if you could, uh, give your perspective on this. Has gold ever been on the USGS Critical Minerals list? Does it appear on the recently released draft 2025 Critical Minerals List.

Speaker 4 [12:32:09 PM]
No, it has not, and it is not.

Speaker 5 [12:32:12 PM]
So this isn't a case of using taxpayer money to secure an at-risk critical mineral and make our supply chain safer. In fact, according to USGS, the United States is already in net exporter of gold. So Doctor Feldge, who does this benefit if taxpayers are helping foot the bill for this mine, will they see a return on that investment?

Speaker 4 [12:32:34 PM]
Well, right now, gold is at record prices. I think, you know, every few days, it sets a new high for all-time high for the price of gold. So companies are not really having a hard time, uh, developing new gold mines or financing their gold mines. So by using some of the Export Import Bank's resources to fund a gold mine. First of all, it's not on the critical mineral list. Second of all, you're taking that money away from other more critical projects that it could be working on, whether it be lithium, either domestically

Speaker 6 [12:33:04 PM]
or internationally, or or other projects that um, you know, need the support much more than a gold mine does.

Speaker 5 [12:33:11 PM]
We as Congress approve billions of dollars to invest in mineral production through the big ugly bill, all supposedly to secure critical minerals. However, instead of utilizing this opportunity to establish a sustainable, resilient and transparent mining industry. The Trump administration is excluding the public from development decisions through rushed 14-day mine permits and investing taxpayer money in gold mines to fill the $4.5 trillion hole that his tax cut s created in our budget. There's work we need to do to secure our critical mineral supply chains. I am absolutely here to work on that, but this is not it. I yield back.

Speaker 3 [12:33:52 PM]
Thank you very much, Representative Begich from the great state of Alaska. You're up for 5 minutes.

Speaker 7 [12:33:58 PM]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Uh, my first question, uh, to Ms. uh, Streaker. Understanding our national balance sheet is such an important objective, and I really appreciated your opening remarks, focused on the importance of inventorying that now national balance sheet through exploration. Uh, can you talk a little bit more about uh the way in which you think that we should approach a sort of, uh, national, uh, this is a national priority, not just for critical minerals, but for all base metals, rare earths, critical minerals, and precious metals, and how we would go about doing that.

Speaker 6 [12:34:35 PM]
Thank you, Congressman, for the question. I think a key element of

Speaker 8 [12:34:41 PM]
capitalizing upon this nation's mineral endowment is to eliminate the cloud of uncertainty that is hung over this industry for as long as I can remember, for the last 30 years, which has been a three-pronged attack through legislative attempts to gut the mining law, administrative, uh, rules and regulations to constrain the ability of people to get on potentially mineralized land and conduct exploration and then most recently this uh problem that's developed out of the Rosemont decision that also casts the cloud on the mining laws. So removing those uncertainties and confirming that the mining law guarantees the security of land tenure that companies need to make the hundreds of millions of dollars of investment that it takes to discover a mineral deposit and then a billion dollar investment to build a mine is going to be critical to capitalizing upon the private sector's ability to work with the country to discover the minerals that are going to help uh relieve our dependency on China.

Speaker 7 [12:35:52 PM]
Thank you. And uh the next question to Mr. Smith. You mentioned capital markets just a moment ago as it as it relates to seabed, uh, mining. But even with bankable feasibility studies, many land-based mining projects either don't receive financial support or must finance at near impossible financing terms. What do you think Congress could do to help mitigate or bridge that gap to ensure that more mining projects receive rational financing terms to proceed.

Speaker 1 [12:36:26 PM]
Uh, congressman, I think, um, when you evaluate projects and you look at the uh the potential that they can bring to the market and the economics they can bring, uh, and you look at the strategic role that that plays with regards to, uh, the supply of metals, um, what would be helpful is, uh, some form of um guarantee or support, uh, showing that the government views this project, um, as an essential component of what is need ed to fulfill the strategy of the government and the goals of the government, uh, and to provide the, uh, the, the, the financiers, uh, with at least some level of uh, of support should things not turn out the way they need to. Um, you know, one of the instances, for example, that we're looking at at the moment, we find ourselves in a, uh, in a catch-22. We need to reach a certain stage before, uh, we'll be able to raise the capital to build the mining ship, for example. However, if we could get, um, you know, some form of guarantee from the government that if we build the mining ship ahead of the um the permissions, um, that we can get financing and build it and should, for whatever reason, our project not get to where it is that the finances at least have a, a soft landing in this case. Uh, but that is all viewed with regards to the risk profile associated with that. You know, if we look at that specific case, if we do build the mining ship, we know of a number of projects that could come online and any one of those could be the company that, um, utilizes it and that would kickstart things. So I think providing that sort of um assurance, almost an insurance policy that the, the finances who get in early, uh, provide the companies the kind of early support that they need. And if it does go south for for um reasons beyond our control, at least there's, uh, you know, a softer landing than just an outright loss would be helpful.

Speaker 7 [12:38:27 PM]
Thank you. And the final question for Doctor Felgus,

Speaker 6 [12:38:30 PM]
uh,

Speaker 7 [12:38:31 PM]
Doctor Felgus, uh, you mentioned gold a moment ago, um, as being recently added to the critical minerals list. Um, are, are you aware, uh, because you, you mentioned the increase in, in, in price recently, uh, dramatic increase, I might add. Uh, are you aware that, uh, central banks around the world have been, uh, significantly increasing their gold reserve holdings.

Speaker 4 [12:38:57 PM]
Uh, I'm not familiar with the actions of other central.

Speaker 7 [12:39:00 PM]
They, they have, and, and the reason I asked the question, I bring up the issues because I think it's important for us to recognize that it isn't only the industrial, uh, potential uses of a particular, uh, mineral that makes it strategic or critical, and uh the recognition worldwide that uh gold acts as a fundamental reserve and a backstop against fiat currency is, I think, worthy of consideration for inclusion in the critical minerals list, and with that, I yield back.

Speaker 3 [12:39:27 PM]
Thank you very much. Next up, uh, Representative Revis for 5 minutes.

Speaker 10 [12:39:32 PM]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, um, for recognizing me. Um, Doctor Feldgus, thank you for your service to this country and your expertise in this field. I wanted to emphasize the importance of community input, um, during the permitting process for hazardous practices such as coal mining. During the Obama administration, secretarial order 3338 was instituted. It paused coldly seen until the Department of Inte ri or completed a programmatic environmental impact statement of the federal coal program and then impact it has on communities that carry the burden of harmful pollution from the coal

Speaker 1 [12:40:13 PM]
industry.

Speaker 10 [12:40:14 PM]
Can you discuss the importance of secretarial Order 3338.

Speaker 9 [12:40:19 PM]
Sure, thank you for the question, Congresswoman. Um, that secretarial order was designed to allow us to do a full review of the the health and economic impacts of the coal program, that type of review had not been done for decades. I think uh since the early 80s, I believe was the last time something like that was done. Um, had that been allowed to continue, that would have been completed a long time ago, and I think we'd have those answers and we'd also have a lot more input from local communities as to what the

Speaker 4 [12:40:49 PM]
coal program, you know, what impact it's having on their lives, not just economically, but also in terms of the health impacts of coal mining and coal burning, and also uh climate impacts.

Speaker 10 [12:41:00 PM]
so then my next question was about the communities um being impacted and if they've had, uh, input, you know, have the communities that have carried the burden of this environmental harm and public health. Have they had their voices heard in this process.

Speaker 4 [12:41:19 PM]
As a over uh overall programmatic. Um, issue, not really. We've certainly looked at individual mine proposals as they come up, whether it's for leasing or expansion of a mine. Uh, we go through or Biden administration went through the NEPA process and made sure that we had community input in the scoping, and then also put out a draft environmental impact statements. We would receive comments on those and then we would respond to those comments. And in many cases, those draft environmental impact statements critically important for identifying issues

Speaker 9 [12:41:52 PM]
that

Speaker 4 [12:41:54 PM]
we're not familiar to the agency beforehand, or for making allowing the agency to make changes into what the conditions of approval might be for a project. Uh, right now, the administration is working to do away with draft environmental impact statements, so we go right from a scoping to final. And it's not clear whether communities would ever get input into this process and whether that input would ever be responded

Speaker 10 [12:42:19 PM]
to. Yeah, so the communities wouldn't even have access to those that draft statement. to provide any feedback or input on that.

Speaker 4 [12:42:27 PM]
That's

Speaker 9 [12:42:27 PM]
correct.

Speaker 10 [12:42:29 PM]
Uh, so yesterday, 65 categorical exemptions were published in the Federal Register that will further append the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. One of the categorical exceptions allows for a short-term mineral energy or geophysical investigation that may require cross-country travel by vehicles and equipment. It feels like HR 4068 are passed, what will happen to the livelihoods of communities that have carried the burden of hazardous coal mining for decades.

Speaker 4 [12:43:05 PM]
Well, it's hard to say exactly what will happen because it's going to be a case by case basis on, you know, what the project is, but certainly by making uh automatically making these projects up to a categorical exclusion, you reduce the potential for communities to weigh in on specific projects. So generally, if there's a categorical exclusion for something, the communities won't even know that something is about to happen until it starts happening. So at least with an environmental assessment, which can still be done very quickly That is announced beforehand that the review was taking place and then the community is able to weigh in with their thoughts on it, and it might be that it's a completely harmless activity that should go ahead and, and that can be done very quickly. But um if there are special circumstances or other issues that need to be addressed, they would have the chance to have their voices heard.

Speaker 10 [12:43:54 PM]
Yeah, so we're basically just getting rid of any community input in this process, unfortunately.

Speaker 4 [12:44:01 PM]
I'm afraid that's the way it's trending right now. Yes.

Speaker 10 [12:44:04 PM]
Um, OK, well, thank you and I yield my time.

Speaker 3 [12:44:07 PM]
Thank you very much. Representative Hagelman from Great State of Wyoming, up for 5.

Speaker 6 [12:44:12 PM]
thank you. I am proud to report that Wyoming has been the leading coal-producing state since 1986, and in 2024, Waing produced 191 million tons of coal and shipped 171 million tons to 26 different

Speaker 9 [12:44:27 PM]
states.

Speaker 6 [12:44:28 PM]
Wyoming produces about 40% of the nation's coal in about 85% of all federal coal production. Uh, the US demand for re li able and affordable energy is increasing every single day, and that includes the demand for coal. Through the president's executive order reinvigorating America's beautiful, clean coal industry and the recently passed one big beautiful bill act. This is one of the most pro pro-coal governments that we've seen in quite some time. This marks a 180 degree turn from the energy poverty policies of the Biden and Obama administrations, something that you seem to be advocating for, Dr. Falga, a continuation of those energy poverty actions and uh the Democrat-led congresses which passed the IRA and other very harmful laws. The Kolac codifies key aspects of President Trump's executive order. It nullifies the DOI's secretarial Order 3338, which placed a moratorium on new federal coal leases and an expedites the leasing process for qualified applications. Uh, the bill requires slight changes and updates to reflect the changing regulatory and legal landscape of federal coal policy and to integrate other positive aspects of the president's executive order. HR 280, the COLA focuses on two key aspects, eliminating eliminating the federal coal moratoriums and expediting coal leasing. I'm going to direct my question to Mr. Diai, who has been a fabulous asset for the state of Wyoming and the country as a whole in terms of providing affordable and reliable energy and other mining project products, and Mr. D. Tyson's Wyoming is the largest coal producer in the nation, and the vast majority of our coal is federal. What impacts do federal moratoriums have for our nation's grid and power

Speaker 9 [12:46:24 PM]
needs. Uh, thank you, uh, Representative Hageelman. It's nice to see you again,

Speaker 11 [12:46:30 PM]
um, it has a tremendous effect because uh as we talked about a little bit earlier about uh projected demand. Uh, we need an all that works strategy and that includes coal, gas, and nuclear, and in order to provide those coal needs I mean, the demand's not going away, and I find it interesting, uh, in the course of the discussions, we hear, oh, Cole's dying, you know, uh, you know, if, if, if the demand truly weren't there, uh, why are we even talking about a moratorium. We have a moratorium in place because folks want to keep the, the, the, the, the resource in the ground, for whatever their reasons, but the demand is there and it's going to grow, and in order for us to meet that demand, you have to have access to the resource. You have to have access, uh, uh, to the coal. You have to be able to lea se coal, and the leasing process takes on average about 11 years. Uh, uh, about 4.5 years is spent on Nipah. Uh, we have not had major leasing activity in this country for the last 10 to 15 years, and we're behind the curve. So, uh, you know, you put that resource off limits, you're putting our, you're putting our grid in jeopardy, you're putting our ability to meet the, the, the projected demand, uh, um, we're not going to be able to do

Speaker 9 [12:47:43 PM]
it.

Speaker 6 [12:47:44 PM]
Well, in 2016, Obama's Interior Secretary Sally Jewell placed a moratorium on this new, on new leasing. That moratorium was lifted the following year, only to be reimposed in 2021 by the Biden administration in 2022, a federal judge reimposed the Obama-era moratorium, and in 2023, the Biden administration announced its intent to initiate yet another EIS to evaluate the impacts of maintaining or revoking the Cole moratorium despite the fact that no such EIS was required. Now I have had the opportunity to visit the coal mines in Wyoming and to stay, to say, state that they are well run, well operated, and in compliance with the federal and state regulations is an understatement. I also would invite members of the committee and others who may have skepticism about coal and our ability to environmentally uh mine such resource to come to Wyoming and actually see the reclamation and the habitat that we provide for a variety of uh wildlife species and things like that, but this whip sawing obviously has an impact upon our company's ability to operate. Mr. D Tai, would you just briefly describe the impact that these changing policies have and why it's important that we get certainty in this area.

Speaker 9 [12:49:01 PM]
Well, absolutely,

Speaker 11 [12:49:02 PM]
uh, Representative Hagelman, the, the industry thrives on certainty. Uh, you know, our, our customers thrive on certainty because we have to send our coal somewhere. And when you have utilities looking, you know, for the last 15 years not being, uh, certain whether the coal resource was even going to be available, that impacts their decisions, and they're not planning year to year, they're planning decade to decade. And so, uh, yeah, yes, absolutely, you need certainty. And I wanna, uh, also quickly point out we've heard a lot about public input. Uh, and I think it's really kind of interesting that throughout this discourse about uh uh moratoriums and the Clean Power Plan and curbing coal use, uh, you know, there, there's been a lot of, uh, uh, a lot of opportunity for public input and, you know, when you go to the state of Wyoming, people of Wyoming have been ignored, completely ignored for the last 15 years when they input is given on whether we should uh uh uh keep our coal resources viable and whether or not we need a a moratorium on this. Yeah, you're, you're right, you, you, you, you, you look at uh uh community involvement, abs absolutely community input,

Speaker 9 [12:50:08 PM]
community

Speaker 11 [12:50:08 PM]
and for for Wyoming has been ignored.

Speaker 6 [12:50:11 PM]
I think that's a very good point, um, Mr. Diai, thank you for being here to provide that valuable testimony and I yield back.

Speaker 3 [12:50:18 PM]
Thank you very much before we go to the next member, I am gonna ask unanimous consent that the following letter from the American Exploration and Mining Association expressing support for HR 1366 and HR 4090 be entered into the hearing

Speaker 9 [12:50:32 PM]
record.

Speaker 3 [12:50:34 PM]
Without objection so ordered. The next up is Representative Downing from the great state of Montana.

Speaker 4 [12:50:40 PM]
Mr. Chair, thank you for holding

Speaker 12 [12:50:41 PM]
this hearing and thank you for allowing me to, uh, once again wave on. uh Cole in critical minerals are vital to America's energy security, economic strength and national defense and communities in the West rely on these industries for good paying jobs. on and for uh affordable power, um, excuse, excuse me about that, uh, and, uh, the raw materials that fuel modern life. So I'm gonna start with Mr. Diai. Um

Speaker 9 [12:51:16 PM]
federal delays

Speaker 12 [12:51:17 PM]
and moratoria in coal leasing have created significant uncertainty for producers and local economies. Can you explain how HR 280 would restore certainty, support coal production, and strengthen US energy security.

Speaker 11 [12:51:33 PM]
Yeah, thank you for the question, Congressman. Uh, yeah, absolutely. The the resource has to be available. Uh, and, you know, for planning purposes, for utilities, to know what they're gonna want, uh, to put on the grid. They, they have an obligation to put the lowest cost, dispatch the lowest cost, uh, uh, uh, resource, uh, Wyoming coal, uh, when, you know, when gas prices are magic number is about $3. Uh, that's when Wyoming coal is competitive. Uh, you know, we've seen, you know, a couple of years ago when gas prices spiked to over $9. Uh, we couldn't get enough coal out of Wyoming to meet the demand for utilities. So the demand is certainly there and uh, you know, we lost about 30 million tons of production that year because the railroads couldn't move what the what the utilities needed. So what I think that says is that the utilities are looking at this and they're saying, you know, we've got to have these resources available. And so, you know, you, you, the, the amount of uncertainty that you've injected by playing ping pong with uh the leasing process has left companies uh up in the air, has left utilities up in the air, not knowing where they're, where, where their fuel's gonna come from. So you, you, you get rid of the lease, quit playing ping pong with this stuff, and, you know, let the market decide. And I would, I would add that, uh, you know, because we've heard about market. The market's deciding where coal is. Well, you know, we've all read our Milton Freeman and, you know, a market implies choices. And when you have one of your choices, uh, that's been overtaxed, overregulated, and in the case of the of the uh BLM Buffalo RMP outlawed. Uh, that's not really a market. And finally, we're seeing some, uh, some, some correction in that, you know, with the, with the lower, lowering of the federal royalty rate with at the state level, we lowered the severance tax on federal coal and uh with some of the regulatory breathing room that we're getting right now. Uh, you know, you've made, you've made the, uh, Wyoming coal, Powder River Basin coal, much more competitive in the market, and that's gonna benefit consumers when utilities have to decide what they're going to dispatch, and it all gets back to the point where you have to keep the resource

Speaker 12 [12:53:35 PM]
available, right? So, uh, moving on, so, uh, HR 4068 codifies categorical exclusions under Nipah to accelerate coal projects. Why is this step critical to maintaining reliable coal power and meeting domestic energy demand, Mr. Dean, yeah, thank

Speaker 11 [12:53:53 PM]
you for the question. Um, you know, again, I think it comes back to, you know, it takes 11 years to get a coal lease, and uh our estimates are about 4.5%, 4.5 4.5 years of that is spent on Nipah work. You have agencies doing duplicative work. Uh, you have, uh, uh, it's, it's, it's become a process where it's protracted, uh, it's become a litigious, and there's gotta be a way to streamline this a little bit because, again, we've had no real leasing activity for over a decade. We're going to need that coal online and it's gonna come up on us sooner than we think. And so, you know, anything that we can do to streamline the process is it's not about cutting the public out, and it's not about uh cutting corners on on environmental safety. I mean, uh, you know, Nipah, Nipah doesn't do anything for the environment. It's, it's what, it's what the agencies do in the regulatory bodies do. It's what the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality does, uh, cuz we manage our, we, we, we have primacy over our CoalPro program. Uh, but we've got to shorten the timeline. Uh, there are ways that you can do it. I mean, what can the agencies uh uh cooperate and, and use one Nipa uh process instead of doing 3 because we have multiple agencies overseeing a lease, and there are ways you can do it, but I think this is a good, it's certainly on the right track that we have to streamline the process. We've got to get this stuff

Speaker 12 [12:55:13 PM]
done quickly. Thank you. Uh, moving on, uh, Ms. Streaker, uh, the Rosemont decision has introduced major uncertainty for mining operations on federal lands. How would HR 1366 provide the clarity necessary for coal and hard rock projects and protect the US mineral supply chain.

Speaker 8 [12:55:31 PM]
Thank you for the question. Well, first of all, 1366 deals only with hard rock mining. It wouldn't have anything to do with coal, but what it would do for hard rock mining is it would give operators the flexibility to locate both mining claims and mill sites on the same parcel of land without considering whether the land is mineral or mineralized. That might seem like a silly thing, but the misinterpretation of the mining law in the Rosemont decision functionally changed the mining law, at least in the Ninth Circuit, that requires uh federal land managers to consider the mineral characteristics of the land during the Nipah process and during the plan approval process to determine that the lands that the company wants to use for mine waste storage, show evidence of being mineralized. And this would eliminate that requirement and add much much needed clarity, and because the Rosemont uh court just simply misunderstood the mining law.

Speaker 12 [12:56:35 PM]
Well, thank you for that answer. Unfortunately I've run out of time, Mr. Chair, I yield.

Speaker 3 [12:56:39 PM]
Thank you very much. Before we go on to, uh, myself, uh, we are gonna, we're hoping we can, we can uh get the ranking member of the full committee, Mr. Huffman here, that's, uh, doesn't look like. OK. I've got a couple of things I want to enter into the record before I make, uh, start my questions. I'm gonna ask the unanimous consent that the following September 20th, 2024, fact sheet from the Biden White House highlighting the Biden administration's actions on critical minerals, noting the approval or support for only 4 upstream mining projects in the United States over the previous 4 years. without objection ordered. And then the other one I ask unanimous consent that the following letter from the center of the American experiment, expressing support for HR 4090 be entered into the

Speaker 4 [12:57:26 PM]
record.

Speaker 3 [12:57:28 PM]
Without objection, so ordered.

Speaker 9 [12:57:31 PM]
So

Speaker 3 [12:57:32 PM]
now I will begin my uh 5 minutes of questioning. um um

Speaker 9 [12:57:42 PM]
let's see

Speaker 3 [12:57:43 PM]
here. One

Speaker 9 [12:57:43 PM]
second.

Speaker 3 [12:58:03 PM]
Here we go. Found my spot.

Speaker 9 [12:58:05 PM]
Uh,

Speaker 3 [12:58:06 PM]
Ms. Streaker, in your testimony, you highlighted the importance of exploration for minerals. What do you believe is the best way for Congress to incentivize more hard rock mineral exploration.

Speaker 8 [12:58:19 PM]
Thank you, Chairman Sauer, for that question. Expediting and incentivizing mineral exploration is, I think, the most important thing that Congress can do to ultimately uh increase domestic mineral production because you can't build a mind if you haven't found the mineral deposit. So what can be done or first to streamline permitting for exploration projects that involve well-known activities like building roads, building drill pads, and expedite that by increasing the acreage that the BLM and the Forest Service can authorize from 5 acres right now on BLM land to, I would suggest 20 acres. Forest Service doesn't have that, uh, notice process at all. So we need to extend the notice process onto National Forest System lands. Secondly, I think there are a number of things we could look to in um some of our partner nations like Canada and Australia that have programs in place to incentivize mineral exploration by allowing people to invest in junior mining companies and take a tax deduction, for example, for uh money spent on mineral exploration. Um, there are things that you could do to provide perhaps grants to companies that are looking for minerals, um, the companies right now are having a really difficult time raising capital for exploration. or

Speaker 3 [12:59:51 PM]
or an incentivizing uh uh businesses and industry to relocate using American Maan minerals,

Speaker 8 [12:59:59 PM]
correct? That's a terrific idea as well, yes, yes.

Speaker 3 [1:00:02 PM]
That was, that was in the, uh, the one big beautiful bill,

Speaker 8 [1:00:06 PM]
right,

Speaker 9 [1:00:06 PM]
right.

Speaker 3 [1:00:08 PM]
Um, so do exploration activities under the mining law require reclamation.

Speaker 8 [1:00:13 PM]
Oh yes, absolutely.

Speaker 3 [1:00:15 PM]
Can you

Speaker 6 [1:00:15 PM]
explain? Sure.

Speaker 3 [1:00:17 PM]
Or give examples.

Speaker 8 [1:00:18 PM]
Yes, OK. So, um, for example, uh, the BLM regulations require that before

Speaker 9 [1:00:27 PM]
exploration

Speaker 8 [1:00:28 PM]
work can start on the ground. The operator has to provide financial assurance or a reclamation bond. And that's in BLM's surface Management regulations at 43 CFR 3809.

Speaker 3 [1:00:42 PM]
So before uh they could begin the expiration, they have to have give financial assurances to the government that reclamation at the end of the process will be taken care

Speaker 9 [1:00:52 PM]
of.

Speaker 8 [1:00:53 PM]
Yeah, and I should clarify that the money that they have to put up front and basically it's a bond that um the state and federal government can use is calculated on the assumption that the government has to do the work. So it's not the cost of the company to do the work, but there's quite an uh inflation on top of what would actually be required on the ground for the um federal government or state government to actually manage the work and hire sub and hire contractors to do it. So it's a very robust, uh, bonding

Speaker 9 [1:01:26 PM]
program.

Speaker 3 [1:01:27 PM]
And uh do you believe that our acquired federal lands are being fully utilized for mineral development.

Speaker 8 [1:01:34 PM]
Oh gosh, no, they are being completely underutilized. I'm going to lace up my geologist boost here for just a minute to tell you that there are many, many mineral deposits or prospective mineral deposits on the nation's acquired lands, and as I mentioned a minute ago, uh, we have about 64 million acres of acquired lands in this country and a minuscule 50,000 acres are under lease right now for either exploration or development. And the reason for that is that the leasing program that is in place on acquired lands simply doesn't work because it's not set up to recognize the geologic realities of looking for hard rock minerals. It has time limits, it has acreage limits that just don't work. Now Secretary Burgum has, um, addressed those at least on a provisional basis, but more needs to be done.

Speaker 3 [1:02:29 PM]
Would Mr. Fallon's legislation help address the issue?

Speaker 8 [1:02:31 PM]
It absolutely would because right now it's unclear that, for instance, lithium on some acquired lands could be leased and, and developed. So absolutely, it's an important component of um more capitalizing more on the mineral resources on our acquired lands.

Speaker 3 [1:02:50 PM]
So what are some of the ways that we can streamline mining on acquired lands in the future.

Speaker 8 [1:02:56 PM]
Well, my suggestion is that you think about making them subject to um location under the mining law. And so that they would come under a self-executing claim system as opposed to a lease system. A lease system kind of requires you to already know where the minerals are, so that you can then apply for the lease. And that works in oil and gas, which are in broad, well understood sedimentary basins, but it doesn't work very well. for hard rock mineral deposits that have a far more specific, um, geology and aerial uh locations. So that would be one thing if you feel that's a bridge too far then to overhaul the leasing program so that you put, you align the interests of the lassor, the federal government, and the lessee, the company, so that they both are headed in the right direction. The way that leasing program is set up right now. it makes mineral discovery very, very difficult. And so, um, you could look, for example, to the leasing program that the state of Utah has on its school trust lands, which puts the um state of Utah and the mineralless sea on the same side of the equation, so that they both want to succeed and the state wants them to succeed. I mean, we hardly produce anything from our federal lands right now and or from our acquired lands, and that's not because they aren't mineralized. It's just because the leasing system is such barrier to um exploration and development.

Speaker 3 [1:04:34 PM]
Thank you very much uh for your, um, answer. I really appreciate that. I am out of town cause out of time rather because I could ask a we call could ask many more, but to the witnesses, uh, I wanna thank you for your valuable time and insight into this, uh, into the, the, the critical minerals and, and uh mining, appreciate it. The members of the subcommittee may have some additional questions for you as witnesses, and we will ask you to respond to these in writing. Under Committee Rule 3, members of the committee must submit questions to the committee clerk by 5:00 p.m. on Monday, September 8th. The hearing record will be held open for 10 business days for these responses. Did you wanna, did you wanna enter in some something in there. Go ahead.

Speaker 10 [1:05:16 PM]
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, I would like to ask, um, unanimous consent to enter these items into the record. A letter of opposition to HR 4018 from the Surfrider Foundation, a letter of opposition to the mining regulatory Clarity Act from the Outdoor Alliance, a letter of opposition to HR 4090 and HR 1366 from the National Parks Conservation Alliance, and a fact sheet from Defend Brooks Range on the economic and mineral realities of the Ambler Road project.

Speaker 3 [1:05:49 PM]

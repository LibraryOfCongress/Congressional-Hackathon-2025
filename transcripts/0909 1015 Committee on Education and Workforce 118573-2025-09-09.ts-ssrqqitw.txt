[10:15:39 AM]

the subcommittee on health, employment, labor pensions will come to order. I note that a quorum is present. Without objection, the chair is authorized to call a recess at any time. Today's hearing will examine the ways in which unions are using federal law to pursue their anti-Israel political agenda, and to harass and discriminate against jewish workers. Today, we'll hear about how unions like the united electrical workers and united auto workers affiliate a better nylag are not ny ag would rather defend union members who engage in disruptive, discriminatory, and anti-semitic behavior than fulfill their duty to fairly represent all the workers they represent. We'll hear today about how their unions are selling them down the river. Even though jewish workers have supported unions and been leaders in the labor movement for generations. This subcommittee held a hearing 14 months ago because we were 

[10:16:39 AM]

concerned about the increase in anti-semitic incidents in our country and in our workplaces. Unfortunately, in the last year, we've seen even more tragic incidents of discrimination and violence against jewish people, including right here in our nation's capital. According to the FBI crime tracking data, anti-jewish incidents are the most common religion related hate crime for a group that represents less than 3% of Americans, jewish people are victims of roughly 60% of all religious based hate crime. Last year, the adl reported over 9300 anti-semitic incidents across the united States, a 5% increase from 2023 and the highest number on record since the adl began tracking anti-semitic incidents in 1979. The unions we will hear about today have chosen to spend time and money advancing their divisive, harmful and anti-american political agenda. 

[10:17:40 AM]

Furthermore, these unions are throwing sand in the gears of employers trying to create workplaces that are not hostile or discriminatory. Discriminatory for the jewish employees. Take, for example, abn. Abn represents public interest lawyers in New York City. When employees put up posters around the office celebrating the actions of hamas and violence against jewish people, the employer banned all posters about the conflict in Israel and gaza. The union did not did not go along with this quietly. Instead, abn filed an unfair labor practice charges against the employer for its policy designed to protect jewish workers. Or take another example, the Cornell graduate student union. This union spends its time trying to stop Cornell from disciplining students who violate school policies. It disrupts campus life and harass jewish students. 

[10:18:40 AM]

When jewish graduate students respectfully ask not to have to fund this union's activities, the union tries to make them pay anyway and threatens to get them fired if they do not pay dues. Flouting title seven of the civil rights act of 1964. Union members have rights under the labor management reporting and disclosure act and the supreme court's beck decision to speak out against these unions and not pay dues for political activities they disagree with. Title seven protects workers who want to live their lives with integrity, and protects them from having to sacrifice their faith and their principles to get and keep a job. But unions have every incentive to keep workers in the dark about their rights. Today, we will hand the microphone over to those who are not truly represented by their unions. We will discuss how the law protects their political and religious convictions, and how lawmakers could provide additional protection. We might not all agree on the appropriate role 

[10:19:41 AM]

of unions in society, but I believe we can all agree that they should use their resources to promote the workplace interests of their employees and treat each worker who relies on them with equal dignity and fairness. With that, I yield to the ranking member for an opening statement. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome back to all the witnesses. Thanks for being here. Let's start by saying no one should be threatened, harassed or attacked because of who they are or who they worship or what they stand for. I agree we should do more to combat anti-semitism in America. I also agree with ranking member Scott of the full committee, who has correctly pointed out that while we have had many hearings on anti-semitism, we have not had one addressing racism, xenophobia, sexism, islamophobia or similar harms confronting workers and student groups. As we discuss these issues today, I want to remind my colleagues that the labor 

[10:20:43 AM]

movement is a large, diverse coalition of workers, of Americans, including jewish Americans, that has been a significant force in the battle against antisemitism. We are fortunate to have Joseph Joseph Mccartin here as one of our witnesses. He is a labor historian and a history professor at Georgetown university, who also serves as the executive director of the kalmanovitz initiative for labor and the working poor. Doctor Mccartin's written testimony details how the labor movement has been among the most important forces countering anti-semitism, and how labor unions are fundamentally diverse. And on a personal note, I'll always also note that he graduated from the best catholic jesuit college in the United States, holy cross in Worcester, which I just happened to go to, as well as doctor Mccartin mentions in his testimony. One of the most 

[10:21:43 AM]

notable labor leaders in one of the most amazing Americans in our history was a jewish immigrant from London, Samuel gompers, a cigar maker by trade and the son of Dutch jewish working class immigrants by way of London. He was the first president of the American federation of labor, and he is reported to have said to be free the workers. American workers must have a choice, to have a choice they must retain in their own hands the right to determine under what conditions they will work. Close quotes. Throughout history, unions have been pivotal in advancing the conditions of the right of workers, from establishing the five day workweek to championing minimum wage, banning child labor, protecting workers from being maimed and killed at work. The labor movement has been instrumental in building and sustaining America's middle class. The labor movement created the American middle class, which is 

[10:22:43 AM]

now under relentless attack. Since returning to office, president trump and his administration have attacked workers right to organize, expose them to exploitative workplaces. And, for example, president trump has stripped nearly half a million, half a million federal workers of their hard won protections in one of the worst, if not the worst, act of union busting in modern American history. He has also undermined the national labor relations board, which is responsible for cracking down on illegal union busting for millions of private sector workers at a time of obscene wealth inequality in the united States, union workers enjoy approximately 20% higher wages and are more likely to have access to benefits such as health insurance, paid leave and pension plans. Union representative workers also have the right to resign from union membership. The right to object to dues beyond. Representational, representational activities 

[10:23:45 AM]

known as the right, which the chairman referred to in his opening comments. Even the right to request religious accommodation for nonpayment of union dues. Unions are legally required to inform workers of their beck rights. Conversely, employers have no obligation to directly inform their workers of their right to organize a union and stand up for better working conditions without retaliation. Our economic system has been rigged against working class for decades, and as lawmakers, we should work to strengthen workers rights to balance the playing field rights so that workers can afford to provide a better life for themselves and their families, to buy a home, and to retire in dignity and give their children a better life than they had. I look forward to today's discussions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back. Okay. Uh, I think the ranking member. And now we will go to the introduction of 

[10:24:46 AM]

witnesses. Uh, sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Uh, few legal matters to take care of, sir. To committee rule eight. See, all members who wish to insert written statements in the record may do so by submitting them to the committee clerk electronically in Microsoft word format by 5:00 pm, 14 days after this hearing, and without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 14 days to allow such statements and other extraneous material noted during the hearing to be submitted for the official hearing record. I know that some of our colleagues who are not permanent members of this subcommittee may be waiving on for the purpose of today's hearing. I was in a hurry to get to our witnesses, so I almost missed that. But, uh, now we'll turn to the introduction of our four distinguished witnesses. Our first witness is Mrs. Kyle Koppelman, senior staff attorney for the New York legal assistance group for New York City. Our second witness is Mr. David Rubenstein, a phd candidate at Cornell 

[10:25:46 AM]

university's department of history in ithaca, New York. Our third witness is doctor Joseph, a Mccartin professor of history and executive director at Georgetown university's kalmanovitz initiative for labor and the working poor in Washington, DC. Our last witness is Mr. Glenn tubman. Tubman, a staff attorney for the national right to work legal defense foundation in Springfield, Virginia. And I trust I got most of those names correct. Uh, we thank the witnesses for being here today, and we look forward to your testimony. Pursuant to committee rules, I would ask that you each limit your oral oral presentation to a three minute summary of your written statement. As committee members have many questions for you, the clock will count down for three minutes pursuant to career committee rule eight and committee practice. However, we will not cut off your cut off your testimony until you reach the five minute mark. I would also like to remind the 

[10:26:47 AM]

witnesses to be aware of their responsibility, to provide accurate information to the subcommittee. I will first recognize Mrs. Mann for your testimony. Thank you. Good morning. I'm Kyle Koppelman, a coordinating senior staff attorney in the immigrant protection unit at the New York legal assistance group, a civil legal services nonprofit. I am also a former member of a better nylag, or abn, a chapter of uaw local 2325, the exclusive bargaining representative that has a duty to fairly represent me. Nylag has been a part of my life for decades. It was founded by my step grandmother in 1990 as a partner agency of united jewish appeal, federation of jewish philanthropies of New York, which still funds its work. I love the work I do, helping my clients, and I once loved the office where I did it. Like you, I'm a public servant because I 

[10:27:47 AM]

care deeply about improving lives. In June 2019, I voted to unionize. I believed collective bargaining would mean better pay, health care caseloads and workplace conditions. In February 2023, I walked the picket line when abn went on strike. However, in 2024, I withdrew from abn as a religious objector after its crusade against Israel following the October 7th hamas attacks. The union turned nylag from a place where I could proudly be jewish and zionist identities, inseparable from me and most Jews into a hostile, anti-semitic workplace. For months, jewish staff faced posters glorifying violence against Jews and Israelis. Intifada. Now long live the resistance and abolish the settler state covered walls. In one of my many complaints to nylag management, I wrote that the images called for, quote, the destruction of the jewish 

[10:28:48 AM]

state of Israel after the massacre, rape and kidnaping of nearly 1500 Jews by hamas, an organization that has murdered countless Jews. The rhetoric in these images is not vague. They are rallying cries for murdering Jews. As a Jew, I feel threatened when I see these and oppressed that they surround to its credit, nylag responded by banning harassing material for many jewish employees instead of supporting us. Abn filed an unfair labor practice charge against nylag for its opposition to anti-semitic material. Abn has failed in its duty to fairly represent all employees. As such, with the Brandeis center for human rights under law, I and several other jewish colleagues have filed complaints with the national labor relations board and the equal employment opportunity commission. We cannot serve the public while enduring abuse at work. Jewish union members have the right to expect that their 

[10:29:48 AM]

union will fight to remediate toxic, anti-semitic workplaces, not be the ones creating them. Thank you. Thank you, miss van. Uh, now, recognize Mr. Rubenstein for your testimony. Good morning. My name is David Rubenstein, and I'm a phd candidate at Cornell university. In fall 2023, a bare majority of grad students voted to install the Cornell grad student union, cgsu, as our exclusive bargaining agent. Cgsu is affiliated with the united electrical workers union, a union that seeks the destruction of Israel. When I objected to campus celebrations of hamas terror after October 7th, a union organizer emailed my whole department, calling me an apartheid apologist. When jewish phd students were targeted in their offices, cgsu claimed Cornell needed its consent to discipline the culprits. When two grad students were suspended for leading a disruptive encampment calling for intifada revolution. Cgsu demanded their reinstatement when contract negotiations began. Cgsu demanded that all phd students be forced to pay union dues. I 

[10:30:49 AM]

and others lobbied the university to reject this violation of free speech and association. Cornell promised to protect our rights. President Mike kotlikoff stated that forced association would be, quote, deeply unfair to our students and incompatible with our commitment to academic freedom. This commitment turned out to be meaningless. When the union threatened to strike, Cornell reneged on its promises and agreed to mandatory dues. The sole exception included what federal law largely provided already that religious objectors and a narrowly defined group with ethical and moral objections could pay a charity instead. Despite this, Cornell assured us that assertions of religious and ethical objections would not be challenged. Yet when I and others submitted objection letters, cgsu subjected us to invasive and burdensome questioning. Cornell then caved again and agreed that students must allow the union to evaluate whether to exempt them from forced dues. Cornell's jewish phd students must now beg the union for permission not to fund its pro-hamas and pro-bds activism. When cgsu refused to process my objection and demanded irrelevant 

[10:31:50 AM]

personal information, Cornell and the union left me no choice but to file discrimination charges at the equal opportunity commission with free legal aid from the national right to work legal defense foundation. Cgsu then belatedly recognized my objection, but other students objections are still being stonewalled. While the students receive zero support from Cornell. Cgsu has since denied the existence of even narrow exemptions from forced dues. This summer, the union began targeting student objectors, claiming we would be fired if we refused to pay them. Cornell initially protested, but then settled with the union despite zero change in its behavior. I know multiple students currently being threatened with termination for not paying cgsu, and Cornell refuses to act to end this harassment. Nearly two years after October 7th, the situation is only getting worse at Cornell. The union uses its power to shield defenders from the consequences for their conduct. Recently, cgsu has rallied to support a self-declared hamas backer with a long record of harassing behavior, including pushing past police to shut down a campus career fair. Though 

[10:32:51 AM]

Cornell belatedly expelled him, the university reversed course after union intervention when his Visa was finally revoked after urging the destruction of America. Cgsu backed his lawsuit. Cgsu never misses a chance to protect bullies while threatening to fire those who refuse to fund them, and it seeks cover by calling this, quote, protected activity under the national labor relations act. I'm a registered Democrat. Protecting students from antisemitism and forced associations should not be a partizan issue. It is wrong to make support of any ideological organization a condition of earning a phd. As the steward of taxpayer dollars, congress should hold Cornell accountable to its obligations under the civil rights act. When Cornell allows cgsu and you to create a hostile environment, it must face consequences. Finally, congress should clarify that phd students are students, not workers subject to forced dues. This was settled law until 2016, when the national labor relations board erroneously classified us as employees. Congress should promptly fill vacancies on the nlrb, so this can be rectified by ensuring degree seekers are rightly 

[10:33:52 AM]

defined as students. Congress can end the intimidation and harassment I and others have experienced from cgsu and you, and the payment of union dues should be strictly voluntary. Thank you for your invitation to testify. Thank you, Mr. Rubenstein. Next, I recognize doctor Mccartin for your testimony. Thank you. Chair. Ellen, ranking member desaulnier and members, I wish to share my perspective as a labor historian on the question you consider today, let me be clear that I'm not here to represent a union, but rather as a scholar of American, of the American labor movement, which is, I would argue, the oldest democratic, multicultural, racially, religiously and regionally diverse institution that united States has produced in its 250 years. I would like to speak briefly of the character of the American labor movement, jewish members important role in its history, and about how the movement historically wrestled with and addressed such issues as antisemitism. My brief 

[10:34:53 AM]

opening remarks. I'm just going to make two quick points. The first is that the labor movement is a uniquely diverse and pluralistic entity, and American Jews have historically played and continue to play an important role in its development and leadership. Labor has been one of the most important forces counteracting antisemitism in America, even as it often found its opponents framing their attacks on it in anti-semitic terms. The pluralistic and inclusive labor movement that emerged in modern America, and within which Jews have played an important role in continue to, was a hard won thing. It was built in a hostile environment where most workers could not count on the law to protect their efforts to organize and bargain collectively until 1935. It was also built by a uniquely diverse working class, the most diverse of any industrialized nation. In this context, 

[10:35:54 AM]

marginalized workers often initially had to build their own separate unions. Blacks were initially excluded from unions on the railways. For example, they formed their own brotherhoods, the most important being a Philip Randolph's brotherhood of sleeping car porters, whose centenary we've recently marked. Similarly, many jewish workers at first opted to form unions of yiddish speaking workers, founding the united hebrew trades in 1888. The unions ultimately, though, affiliated with the American federation of labor. Though the uft persisted at its as its own organization, ultimately, it should be said, giving birth to the jewish labor committee in 1934, whose explicit purpose was to fight Nazi anti-semitism. It exists, by the way, to this day, as a presence in labor. Remarkably out of this fraught crucible of a working class, a vast diversity, and despite employers conscious efforts to pit one group against another, to undermine union organizing 

[10:36:55 AM]

and to break strikes. The union movement arose that became ever more inclusive over the course of the 19th and 20th centuries, jewish workers have played a vital role in that history, and they continue to. At its founding in 1886, the American federation of labor was, as ranking member desaulnier notes, headed by a jewish immigrant, Samuel gompers, who was elected to his post. Even though Jews were then far outnumbered by protestants and catholics within the AFL. Nor was gompers unique. Jewish leaders such as Sidney hillman, Bessie Abramowitz, rose Schneiderman, David Dubinsky, Clara lemlich, Jerry wurf, Albert Shanker, Sandra Feldman, Randi Weingarten, to this day have helped to build inclusive, multiracial, pluralistic unions that have fought for American workers of every race, religion, and color over decades and into the present. It would not be an 

[10:37:55 AM]

exaggeration to say that each of those leaders contended at times with anti-semitism, but the anti-semites they fought were typically opponents of the union movement who used their very prominence within it as evidence that it was somehow foreign, un-american, or even part of a worldwide jewish conspiracy. In part because of the minority status of America's jewish activists, they have always understood the importance of building bridges across lines of difference, creating unity among workers. Jewish influence remains strong in labor today. Antisemitism hasn't gone away. Of course, no one can certify that there are no anti-semites in the labor movement, but where it does rear its head, it must be combated. Yet the historical record clearly shows that labor has been a bastion of opposition to antisemitism and remains so. Second, and very quickly, the labor movement is a democratic movement. It allows for free speech and 

[10:38:55 AM]

difference of opinion. Much of what we'll hear today speaks only to that aspect of it. These two elements, its democracy, its diversity can allow it to be characterized. But its record, I think, is clear. Thank you. Thank you, doctor Mccartin. And now I recognize Mr. Timmerman for your testimony. Thank you for the opportunity to appear today. I have been practicing labor and constitutional law for over 43 years at the national right to work legal defense foundation. My clients are individual employees who wish to stand apart from a workplace labor union. They did not choose and do not want. I was honored to testify before this committee exactly 14 months ago, detailing the workplace harassment that labor unions 

[10:39:56 AM]

fomented against jewish and Israeli students at elite universities teaching hospitals K through 12 schools and legal aid workplaces. I am back to report that things are worse than ever due to ever more virulent union antisemitism, which is actually fostered and protected by our nation's misguided labor laws. More than ever since October 7th. My phone is continuing to ring off the hook with calls from unionized jewish and Israeli graduate students at the nation's elite universities, and interns and residents at esteemed teaching hospitals asking me how they can disassociate from unions like the U. The uaw and seiu, these unions or their radical affiliates, foment chants of anti-semitic slogans, ostracize the jewish and Israeli employees they purport to represent, and generally menace 

[10:40:57 AM]

them in their workplaces. In recent months, I have read commentary to the effect that what jewish and Israeli employees are facing in the workplace is not a real problem, and that the trump administration is weaponizing overblown charges of antisemitism to tear down universities and education. Such assertions are false and stomach turning. So I want to speak about the real weaponization that is at play in today's workplace the weaponization of an archaic federal labor law that congress passed over 80 years ago, which empowers labor unions with unique privileges granted to no other private organization in America. Today's labor unions are not your fathers labor unions. Many of today's Progressive unions harbor strong anti-semitic and even anti-american worldviews, and they feel free to use and abuse the potent power congress gave them to harass and intimidate jewish and Israeli employees. 

[10:41:57 AM]

Federal law empowers them to do so in specific ways. First, federal labor law empowers unions to act as employees. Exclusive bargaining representative, even when the employees don't want to be represented by such hostile and hateful organizations. Second, the Clinton, Obama, and Biden nlrb transform graduate students from students to employees, thereby paving the way for radical unions to represent them and force them to pay dues whether they want to or not. Third, under the Biden nlrb extravagant view of union power and the Home Depot ruling unions, outrageous pro-hamas activities, and even workplace intimidation are considered to be, quote, protected concerted activity, unquote, meaning union actions that are overtly hostile to Jews are coddled and protected by federal law. And fourth, labor law authorizes unions to 

[10:42:59 AM]

demand compulsory union dues, which allows anti-semitic unions to force the victims of the harassment to pay for those activities or be fired. At the national right to work legal foundation, we are redoubling our efforts to help such employees. But despite our best efforts, title VII of the civil rights act, the beck decision and the duty of fair representation doctrine are inadequate. So what are the solutions? First, congress should pass the national right to work act to end the problem of coercive forced unionism. Second, congress should enact legislation redefining graduate students as students, not employees, as they were for the first 60 years. And third congress should strengthen title seven to better protect employees of faith from unions, anti-semitism, and radical ideologies. These would be small steps to restore individual employees right to not be part of a forced collective that takes hateful, 

[10:43:59 AM]

pro-hamas views on foreign events 5000 miles away from the workplace. What could be more American than that? And I want to conclude by saying that Samuel gompers, who we've heard the jewish afl-cio chairman, also said that the workers of America prefer organizations of a voluntary nature rather than organizations of compulsion. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your testimony. Under rule. Under rule nine, we will now question witnesses under the five minute rule. I will recognize myself for five minutes. Um, obviously, we sit here today, thousands of years after Abraham's covenant with god, and the battle still rages. Uh, miss Mann, you and many of your jewish coworkers were supportive of the union before 

[10:45:00 AM]

October 7th, 2023. Have jewish colleagues withdrawn from union activities or stopped attending meetings due to fear of harassment or hostility? Miss Mann? Uh, how has the union's cultivation of this hostile office culture weakened jewish members ability to benefit from union representation and collective bargaining? Yes. I, along with several other jewish members, have obtained religious objector status because we do not believe the union can fairly represent us. Um, some jewish members only attend on zoom because they can't face the hatred in person in 2025. Uh, a better nylag went on strike for a week. Their number one sticking point was not salary, health care, or caseload. It was free speech in and out of the office. The ability to support hamas over its jewish workers. Um, the the union has targeted Jews. Um and 

[10:46:01 AM]

sent emails. Members have sent emails to other staff members excluding all Jews in the office. Um, there has been no declaration that this was intentional, but it can't be a coincidence that only jewish members have been left off of these emails. Thank you, Mr. Rubenstein. You have filed discrimination charges against the union with the eeoc, which you included as an attachment to your written testimony. How did the union and unions and Cornell's actions give you no choice but to file charges with the eeoc? Cornell could have denied the union's demand for mandatory dues, but instead made me proactively seek out a religious exemption upon contract ratification, Cornell claimed I had nothing to worry about because I could religiously object by ticking a box on a form that never materialized. Instead, I had to beg union bosses for permission by sending a highly personal letter detailing the private details of my religious beliefs and practices. It felt deeply 

[10:47:03 AM]

humiliating and degrading to need to beg for permission from those engaged in Jew hatred. Yet even that was not enough for these union bosses, and they demanded further irrelevant personal information, not only about myself, but also about my synagogue and my rabbi. And at that point, because Cornell was forcing me to pay dues and the union was demanding information, they had no right to, I had no other choice but to press charges. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You represent several employees seeking religious accommodations from the unions that represent them. Could you discuss whether title seven of the civil rights act provides sufficient protections for people of faith in unionized workplaces? And is there anything we can do to strengthen legal protections for religious workers in unionized workplaces? Title seven provides some protections, but as Mr. Rubinstein just said, the problem with title seven is these employees are essentially required to beg their 

[10:48:04 AM]

tormentors. I'll say that again. You have to ask the entity that is harassing you and tormenting you on your workplace for a religious accommodation. And that's the worst part of this, because title seven requires you to prove to a certain level your sincerely held beliefs. But who do you have to prove it to? To the union that is tormenting you. So this should be something that congress can fix by making it easier for people to assert their religious rights. Could you define tormenting? I mean tormenting, meaning ostracism, shunning? Uh, hamas pro-hamas activities, telling your graduate students paid dues or be fired while we're out fomenting pro-hamas activities? Hamas is a medieval killing terrorist group on the us watch list, but suddenly it's 

[10:49:04 AM]

protected labor free speech to support an anti-american, murderous medieval terrorist group. That's what the labor laws bring to this situation. Thank you. Uh, that concludes my questions. Uh, unless the panel has anything else you'd like to offer. Okay, well, I I'll yield my time to the Mr. Mrs. Lee of Pennsylvania. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think it's important that we are clear about what's really going on here. Republicans are committed to eroding labor protections in this country, and they will do anything and use anything. To that end, the attacks on workers are relentless. And let's be clear, when they attack unions, they are attacking jewish workers and black workers and white workers and disabled workers, all workers. Just last month, the department of veterans affairs terminated collective 

[10:50:05 AM]

bargaining agreements for workers at the Pittsburgh va medical center in my district, abandoning groundskeepers, transportation workers, nurses and doctors unions. Just like our government, our democratic institutions, workers choose to unionize based on majority support. Just like Cornell, graduate workers voted to unionize 1873 votes to 80. Unions are also a channel for their members to debate and voice beliefs and political issues. Just like when uaw debated and voted to adopt their ceasefire resolution 1067 votes to 570. In democracies, we're supposed to accept the outcome of a vote, even if we disagree with it. As democratic institutions, unions bear responsibility for protecting their members from acts of hate. Absolutely. While fostering environments for critical and constructive discourse, because unions, because union members will never agree on every point and they aren't meant to. Being engaged in a union where you have a stake and a say means having uncomfortable 

[10:51:06 AM]

conversations. But discomfort and danger are not the same thing. And at a time when those in power are looking for any excuse to undermine worker protections, it is more important than ever that we understand and make that distinction. Those of us who believe strongly in unions recognize that while organized labor may have had a complicated legacy, especially considering its history dealing with and even excluding marginalized groups that today they work to remedy that because they know, and we all know that for marginalized groups, it is the number one pathway to economic security and a place in the middle class. We fight and we work every day with unions, just like we do with our own nations governments, and make sure that they live up to their true ideals. Unions are institutions that reflect the demographics and the diversity of our workplaces, and we have more work to do, just as we have more work to do to make our country that more perfect union. But there is no question that if we actually want workers to be protected, we need unions. And if we want unions to be equitable, we cannot ask them to be apolitical. Uh, doctor 

[10:52:07 AM]

Mccartney, can you speak briefly about the history of workers taking political stances through their unions at critical times in history? Thank you. Thank you, congresswoman. I'm happy to. Unions from their formation in the United States have realized that they have to take political stands to effectively defend and advance the interests of their members. That was true in the 1820s, when the first unions hoped to launch their own political parties, workingmen's parties. That was true in the early 20th century, when Samuel gompers drafted labor's bill of grievances because the courts were attacking workers rights to strike effectively to organize, and they knew they had to get political to fight back against that. That was true in the 1960s, when the labor movement supported the civil rights and the voting rights act, because they understood that what could be won at the bargaining table could be undermined by politics if workers didn't have a democratic voice there. That 

[10:53:07 AM]

has been the labor movement's history. That is its stand even today. Yes. And if I could ask you another question very quickly, historically, how has social inequality coincided with the strength or lack thereof, of labor unions? Social inequality has been in inverse proportion to union strength. When union strength is strong, social inequality is weak. When union is, strength weakens, social inequality grows. That was true in the 1920s, when the labor movement hit one of its low points. Inequality surged after world War two, when the labor movement was strong, inequality dropped. Economists talk about the period of the great compression because the lowest, the the poorest 20% of Americans saw their income rise most then when unions weakened in the 20th and early 21st century, however, we've seen inequality surge. Perhaps 

[10:54:08 AM]

members here know of the recent study by the Rand corporation, which documented that if we had merely retained the distribution of income we had in 1973 to the present day, the lowest 90% of Americans would have earned, yeah, $79 trillion more than they ended up earning. That's because of union weakness. And if I could conclude, I just want to say that this is obviously not about protecting workers. It's been about silencing dissent, criminalizing free speech, and chipping away at the foundation of our democracy in order to accelerate a shift toward authoritarianism. Unions are the first line of protection against that. And we have to speak out against these attempts to suppress these unions. Thank you. And I yield back. Gentlelady yields. Now, call on our great chairman for his questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And let me make it very clear. We're not attacking unions. We're attacking abusive union leadership that are not doing what they're supposed to 

[10:55:08 AM]

do for their union membership. I thank unions for the working conditions I had at U.S. Steel southworks because of what my dad, as a union organizer and others did. We're talking about the backing away of protecting union workers. We're not attacking unions here. And I think that's why the Republican party is now being seen as the party of the working man and woman. The rank and file. Randi Weingarten has not said anything. Anything about anti-semitism. So to raise her name raises my ire. This man, your testimony is very clear. So let me go back. Have there been instances where the union has chosen to advance the interests of those engaging? And I'm talking about the union leadership. Protecting the 

[10:56:09 AM]

interests of those engaging in harassing contact conduct over the interests of unions, jewish members. Yes. Um, very sadly, the union has doubled down on protecting its members ability to promote anti-semitism and images that make Jews feel threatened in the workplace. Um, as soon as our poster policy was enacted, um, requiring that the office simply be neutral, that nobody post anything related to the gaza Israeli conflict. Um, what's wrong with that in the office? Exactly. That's all we're asking for. We just don't. At 5:00 pm, when you leave the office, you should be free to say whatever you want about whatever issue it is. You have complete free speech, American liberty. But when you're in the office, you don't have a right to free speech. And that's all that nylag management asked, um, to be done as soon as that happened. Um, abn posted 

[10:57:09 AM]

watermelons all over our office, a symbol of Palestinian solidarity, and over the watermelons. It says nylag violates free speech. Um, by nylag silences workers. Um, and they continue these tactics, holding lunchtime pickets where they walk around the office and keffiyehs, um, holding Palestinian flags. They pose for pictures in our reception area. These images are are visibly seen by clients, um, not just jewish members, but we serve the most vulnerable populations in New York City, and they too are traumatized by walking into our office. We have to shield them from the images that surround our cubicles and try as quickly as possible to get them to a conference room without seeing so many of the intimidating, harassing materials that surround the office. Cowardly union leadership that's encouraging this type of thing to go on, as well as entities that don't stand up against it. 

[10:58:10 AM]

So I appreciate that. Mr. Rubenstein. Um, united, as you've indicated, united electrical workers union leadership and the Cornell graduate student union leadership, um, chose to help fellow graduate students avoid university discipline and expulsion and deportation by the us government. The student engaged in disruptive anti-Israel advocacy on campus, as well as cheering for the and I quote, end of the us empire celebrating hamas actions on October 7th and tweeting that zionists are a, quote, moral, less soulless, cowardly, inhumane, inhumane bunch. What do you think of the union leadership using its resources to defend this graduate student? Well, that is certainly the union's prerogative to defend such an individual. And I want to be clear, I'm not anti-union and I believe in free speech. So if they want to support someone like that, absolutely fair game. But jewish students should not be forced to 

[10:59:10 AM]

financially support that. And we should certainly not be forced to beg for permission to not do so, as Cornell is currently forcing us to do. Thank you for nailing that home. The issue that we're talking about there, and then that goes back to free speech and freedom in America. Thank you, Mr. Taubman. Uh, the duty of fair representation doctrine was intended to protect workers in the bargaining unit who may be in the minority in the union, and to force unions to represent those people fairly as well, even if the union leadership did not like those workers or agree with their views. Have you seen unions violate the duty of fair representation with respect to jewish employees? The duty of fair representation, if properly interpreted, would prevent exactly what Mr. Mann and Mr. Rubenstein are seeing on their campuses or their workplaces. The problem is that over the years, the duty of 

[11:00:11 AM]

fair representation has been watered down, and it is very difficult for employees to use that to protect themselves from this sort of anti-semitic, uh, atrocities. Thank you. My time is expired, I yield back. I was a little lenient on our chairman there on time, but anyway. We're getting less lenient in one of our other, uh, members. Take it from Mr. Wilson. Okay. Who again? Mr. Wilson's next. All right. I'll now recognize Mr. Wilson from the great state of south Carolina for his line of questioning. Thank you very much, chairman. I'm very grateful to share a district with you, uh, north Augusta, Augusta, South Carolina, Georgia working together. And indeed, um, Mr. Tubman, I appreciate your service as the staff attorney for the national right to work legal defense foundation. For decades, the national right to work committee has been a successful 

[11:01:13 AM]

champion across the country for workers to have the freedom to join or not join a union. And so the right to work committee is just, um, such an example of freedom. And so thank you for what you do. With that in mind, your written testimony says that some unions are weaponizing our labor law to harm jewish employees in the workplace. How are they doing that? And can you give examples? Sure. So as I said in my opening there, federal law allows forced representation. Nobody tells you, congressman, that when you want to sell your house, you must use a certain representative who may hate you and may trash your people and your religion. But in the union context, federal labor law allows for forced representation. So these people are required to be represented by a hateful organization. That's the first of federal laws, protections of unions. And then the second one, of 

[11:02:15 AM]

course, is forced dues. They're told that they have to pay for the privilege of being harassed by these unions. This is all a matter of federal labor law. And I want to thank you to bringing up the issue of hamas. We're not talking about people who are disagreeing with issues, uh, hamas, uh, the covenant of August 1988 was very clear. Article seven. It states that every Jew is to be chased behind a rock or a tree until you find the last Jew behind a rock and kill him. That's their covenant. That's their plan. From the river to the sea, uh, means the elimination and death of the jewish people. And so, uh, we're not talking about just a disagreement over policy. Uh, miss Mann, uh, some unions have chosen to mount defenses of anti-semitic activity in their units and in some cases, advocate on behalf of union members who have engaged in anti-semitic, uh, conduct, uh, 

[11:03:16 AM]

outside the workplace, particularly something that sounds so innocent, such as pushing the anti-Israel boycott, divestment and sanctions, bds, uh, policies. Uh, what do you feel can be done? Does this, uh, undermine the national labor relations act? I think that. I believe that unions should stick to negotiating wages, health care, employment conditions. The union should not have a political view that's unrelated, unrelated to its members well-being in the workplace. Just because unions were once politically active historically does not mean they need to be now. Times change. We shouldn't have to vote about political resolutions on anything about foreign policy. That has nothing to do with representing um individuals in New York City. Um, the resolution that was mentioned by miss Lee was a resolution 

[11:04:18 AM]

that was, uh, sent by abn less than a month or, sorry, just over a month after 1013, asking union members to vote on whether they support calling the the, um, Israeli, uh, sorry, calling Israel's attack on on palestine a genocide. We shouldn't be forced to to answer such questions. It doesn't matter to our workplace. It doesn't matter to what we do for our clients. Political foreign relations should not be a part of the union's purview. And how sad indeed genocide. The population of gaza has increased substantially. Uh, there's not a genocide. And how sick, uh, for people to misconstrue what's going on. And Mr. Rubenstein, you said in your written testimony that you did not believe graduate students should be considered employees under the national labor relations act. Why do you think that graduate students 

[11:05:19 AM]

like yourself, young as you are, should not be covered by lr nlra? As phd students were provided with teaching assistantships to support ourselves while we work towards our degree, and so our work as teaching assistants serves as a derivative of our primary status as students. Yet, since unionization, our primary role as students has become a derivative of our part time job as teaching assistants, meaning that we now have a nonacademic third party that holds power over the primary purpose for which we came to study in the first place. Well, thank you for bringing that to the attention of the American people, I yield back. Okay. Uh, from South Carolina yields. Now we go to chairwoman emeritus fox from North Carolina for questions. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that. And I appreciate our witnesses being here today. I know this is a very tough issue, uh, for you 

[11:06:20 AM]

all to be dealing with, especially, uh, Mr. Mann and Mr. Rubenstein, um, because there's so much involved with this. So I really appreciate your being here, miss Mann, your written testimony discusses how jewish employees are afraid to speak up about the toxic workplace the unions created. Why do you believe they're afraid to speak up? I believe they're afraid to speak up because they have already experienced the feeling of being ostracized. We never considered ourselves as a separate group in the office, but we've essentially been pushed into our own little jewish ghetto, where we can only discuss matters of the office with each other. We don't feel that the union has our back. And in fact, before this last strike, many of my jewish colleagues who had not yet obtained religious objector status felt that the union was 

[11:07:21 AM]

pressuring them to go on strike because their primary goal was not increasing our wages or getting us better health care. It was fighting the nylag management policy that posters not be posted in the office about anything related to this conflict. They argued again that they have the right to free speech in the office, and the union has misled them because there is no right to free speech in a private workplace. Um, the union has told them that the poster policy is an egregious, quote, an egregious infringement on our member speech and a violation of labor law, unquote. Um, what what you're talking about sounds so much like what happened in Germany a long time ago. And we've all said never again. This kind of thing can never happen again. Um, Mr. Rubenstein, your written testimony includes exhibits of 

[11:08:21 AM]

many emails documenting how the union and Cornell have tried to enforce the forced dues clause in the collective bargaining agreement. Could you discuss whether the union has communicated to graduate students clearly and honestly, what their rights and obligations are with respect to the union? It has not, um, we have the right to object to union dues on religious, ethical or moral grounds. And yet the union has consistently represented that all graduate students are forced to pay dues or agency fees to the union, negating that third option. So what do you think could be done to make sure that people in unionized workplaces like yours know their rights? Well, the first answer to that is that one should not be forced to go through a burdensome and time consuming exemption procedure in order not to fund a union that that one does not wish to support. Union dues should be voluntary. But while Cornell is locked into a contract with 

[11:09:21 AM]

forced dues, the university should make clear that all exemptions will be recognized, that individuals do not need to beg for the union's permission, with the union being given free rein to obstruct, ignore or deny these exemptions. The university can recognize them. Mr. Taubman Mr. Rubinstein's written testimony and what he has said verbally. Um, discuss receiving an intrusive questionnaire from the union, which he's alluding to again when he tried to obtain a religious accommodation. What responses have your clients had other workplaces received when they invoked their rights under title seven of the civil rights act? The first response that the union gave my clients at mit, who were jewish, was to write them a letter saying Jews can't object to our union because our founder was jewish. So they told these people that they know more about their 

[11:10:23 AM]

judaism and their religious beliefs than they do. Since that time, the union has been sending these invasive questionnaires, and this has happened at Stanford. This has happened at Cornell. This has happened at other schools. They try to conduct a little mini inquisition to harass and delay and prevent these people from exercising their religious liberties under title seven. Thank you. And I think the term you used earlier about torture is certainly very appropriate. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to insert in the record an article from the Wall Street journal, August 29th. Stanford's graduate student union tries to stifle dissent. Without objection. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. The gentlelady yields back. Next is ranking member Scott for five minutes. Excuse me. Go ahead. 

[11:11:23 AM]

Can you call on Mr. Courtney? Mr. Courtney is recognized. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to our ranking member, Scott. And I apologize a lot going on today, but I did read, um, again, the witnesses statements and, um, again, um, you know, want to thank all of you for being here and the effort that you put in to to your testimony. Um, miss Meehan in particular, I found your testimony to be actually quite powerful in terms of just telling your story as a former public defender, I sort of identify a little bit, at least with the mission of a legal aid. Um, and you obviously are very passionate about your clients in terms of trying to, you know, advocate for fairness and justice, you know, in, in the system. And, you know, that's not for the faint of heart. Uh, I can personally attest to that. And obviously, you also, you know, described your sort of, you know, sort of foundational feelings about unions a little 

[11:12:24 AM]

bit. And I guess the one question I just really wanted to ask you was that, you know, after reading your testimony and, um, you know, there are some really important issues that everybody's raised in their testimony, but there's obviously also another sort of agenda here, which is to pass a national right to work law. Uh, and I just was curious just to hear what your thoughts were about whether or not that somehow, you know, would be a solution to, you know, the problem that's been identified here? Uh, because that would be a fairly, um, uh, blunt instrument, you know, in terms of, uh, the rights of workers who, again, work, who belong to unions that are actually doing good things for themselves. Yeah. There's the union members that I work with. While they have been told, um, that they are aware of their rights, most of them did not know that they had the right to file for a religious objector status. I understand that I'm really talking about we're here as 

[11:13:24 AM]

members of congress to deal with legislation, and there's a bill to to pass a national right to work law. And that's really my my question. Do you I mean, do you feel that that is something congress should take up and that and that would be a solution? Um, in terms of, you know, really radically rewriting, rewriting, uh, the labor laws of this country, I think, as Mr. Rubinstein said, the labor laws need to be addressed under the current framework. Um, and then and lrb should take up the claims that we filed with them, um, about an unfair representation and the duty to represent. Thank you. So right to work, I mean, is really just as I said, it's a far blunter sort of instrument in terms of addressing this issue. And I and I certainly agree with you about, you know, having the nlrb act swiftly, it did not help matters that the president, almost the day after he was inaugurated, uh, basically, um, 

[11:14:26 AM]

fired, uh, a member and they don't have a functioning quorum so that, you know, the goal of actually having timeliness in terms of taking up issues, um, has been paralyzed by this administration. Um, uh, doctor, uh, Mccartan, as some of my colleagues know, I kind of always track the Gallup poll in terms of American public opinion regarding labor unions. They've been asking this question since the 1930s. Actually, a few days ago, they they did their 2025 update. And again, it was a 68% approval rating. Uh, it's eight straight years now, um, that it's exceeded 60%. And I've been around long enough in this committee to remember when it was much lower than that. And I was wondering if you just sort of comment in terms of particularly at a time when we're watching healthcare get cut through H.R. One, um, the, um, exchange premiums, uh, are about to be devastated. Um, and 

[11:15:27 AM]

rates are going to skyrocket literally within days. We're going to get those numbers in terms of just what's driving that popularity because of the economic insecurity that working people feel in this country. The weakening of unions in general, um, is one of the things that's contributing to growing inequality, to the impact, the adverse impact of the kind of cuts that you're talking about and what they will have fighting for a national right to work act. As Mr. Taubman is calling for, is not going to solve the problem of anti-semitism or improve the bargaining power of workers. Um, it's really a non-sequitur, uh, when it comes to the question that we're considering here today as well. That is, do unions promote antisemitism? Union members have rights. There's been lots of talk that union members are. Unions are not properly defending their members, representing them today. I would assert that they 

[11:16:30 AM]

resent their members as well as anybody on this panel represents your constituents. That doesn't mean that your constituents agree with everything you do. They don't. Um, that doesn't make your positions any less legitimate. That's what unions are about, representing people. And they might not do it, uh, to the satisfaction of every member we've heard from both Mr. Mann and Mr. Rubinstein that that they don't want to support an organization, okay, that that they, uh, object to. And they're not they they have the right not to and they're not. Time is expired. The chair now recognizes himself for five minutes. Uh, thank you to all the witnesses. Um, here today. Um, I'll begin with the principle that I think everyone should agree with. No employee should be required as a condition of their employment to financially support a 

[11:17:30 AM]

political agenda or candidate that he or she opposes. Uh, this is a an application of the first amendment and a cornerstone of American liberty. The supreme court agrees in Janus V asked me, the supreme court recognized that federal employees first amendment rights are violated when employees who are not members of the union are forced to pay agency fees. The court said that such agreements violate the free speech right of nonmembers by compelling them to subsidize private speech on matters of substantial public concern, and given that government unions, uh, everything they do have to do with matters of public concern, free speech would be violated. It is great that government employees first amendment rights are protected. But what about private sector workers? The supreme court case communication workers of America V beck, partially protects employees from being forced to contribute to political causes they disagree 

[11:18:31 AM]

with, but it is clear from the witness testimony today that beck is not strong enough. At Cornell university, Mr. Rubenstein and his jewish friends were continually harassed by their graduate student union for refusing to fund their affiliate unions. Pro-hamas agenda at the new York legal assistance group, miss Mann and her jewish colleagues fear expressing support for Israel in their office because of the anti-semitic climate created by the union. Uh, even though she was exercising her backed up opt out rights. Mr. Taubman, uh, you helped litigate cwa V beck. Uh, why is beck insufficient today for jewish employees? And, um, those who, for other reasons, do not want to support their unions politics. Beck is inadequate, first of all, because many employees have no idea that it exists, and unions have no incentive to tell them, because if they find out, then 

[11:19:32 AM]

the union gets less money. Second of all, look at what happened with you at mit. People filed beck objections in 2004 and 2005, and the you gave them financial disclosure from 2018 and 2019, five and six year old financial disclosure. So how are people supposed to know what the union is doing with their money when the union won't open up their books to tell them? And I just want to address this point about right to work, that congressman Courtney paints this as some kind of radical thing. Right to work. It's called free choice. In America. No one tells you what church to join. No one tells you to join the elks club or not join the elks club. No one tells you to join the aa for your car, but federal law tells you join this union, this hamas supporting terror 

[11:20:32 AM]

organization, or we'll get you fired. And I could show you hundreds of threats to get employees fired. That's American. Okay. Free choice in America to join a private organization. Unions are not government. Unions are a private organization. And I think it's a disgrace that any American has to fund a private organization that they don't want to. And it's sometimes said that these unions have been chosen in a certification election. But many times that happened decades or even generations ago. Um, do you care to comment? I think the last statistics I saw was that 90 some percent of employees have never voted for the union that represents them, and even if they have, I can tell you from experience, trying to decertify a union is difficult, if not impossible. And, um, I think Mr. Rubenstein alluded to this, and you may know the law 

[11:21:34 AM]

on this, this I've not heard of this phenomenon before, of having to go to your union and apply for a religious exemption. What's that all about? So what that's all about is under title seven, you have to show that you have a sincerely held religious belief. But who do you go to to apply and prove that you have a sincerely held religious belief, the party that's forcing you to pay the dues, and that in this case, it's either Cornell and or the union, the party that's taking your money. Well, thank you, I yield back. Our ranking member, Scott, is recognized for five minutes. Thank you. And I thank all our witnesses for, uh, for coming. Um, Mr. Mccarron, we've heard a lot about the right to work law and some of the things that people don't like about it. If you're in a right to work state and not join the union didn't pay any dues. Do you get the benefits of all of the, um, 

[11:22:37 AM]

benefits that have been achieved by the unions like higher pay, safer workplace, better benefits? You get individual? Yes. You do. Do you get individualized representation to the same degree as dues paying members? That's correct. I don't hear any complaints about that. No. In fact, right now, if Mr. Rubenstein had a grievance with Cornell university, the union that he is attacking would be compelled to defend him in that grievance. Thank you. Um, if you find we've said if you have found religious or racial discrimination in a union, you can go to the eeoc. Is that that is correct. And, um, the funding in the Republican budgets have cut the eeoc. Yes, they have. Okay. Uh, now, anti-semitism is a problem in society. Is it more or less of a problem in unions? I would 

[11:23:38 AM]

say that it's less of a problem in unions, because unions have long understood that anti-semitism is a threat to the whole idea of a union. And is there is there are there problems with racism, islamophobia, homophobia, gender based discrimination in society? That is true in unions have understood that they needed to fight those. And, um, is that problem more or less than in society? I would say less. The union movement has been a force against all of those things. We're aware of gender and racial pay differences on the pay differences, uh, more or less in unions or in the general public. They are less in unions. And that's because everybody gets equal pay for equal work in a union contract. Unions fight for their members on a basis of equality. Um, we've heard about the, uh, religious exemption. Is there a similar exemption if you, if a black 

[11:24:41 AM]

person were to decide that the union was run by racists, do they have a way to get out? No, they can go to the eeoc. But to my knowledge, not a similar way. Thank you. I yield back, the gentleman yields back the chair next, uh, recognizes Mr. Fine for five minutes. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And look, I want to start by apologizing to those of you, particularly the two of you on my left. You've had to deal with this. I understand what it's like to deal with anti-semitism. I dealt with it my whole life. Ironically, you know, the institution I went to 35 years ago where the problem is widespread today, it doesn't really exist today. But I'm also angry. I mean, what's clear is that Muslim terror has come to the United States, and it exists in our universities. And I noted in your testimony, just to give a couple of interesting points about it. Before I get to my question, um, miss Mann, you talked about the 

[11:25:44 AM]

first example of Muslim terror stuff on your in your institution on October the 13th. And Mr. Rubinstein, in your testimony, you talked about it on October 25th at Cornell. I read your statements before I got here. Um, Israel did not send ground forces into gaza until October the 27th. So to be clear, the Muslim terrorists were focused through your institutions on on spewing their propaganda and hate before Israel had even responded. And that just shows you how the kind of evil that we are dealing with. The good news is, thanks to the chairman and others up here, we are willing to fight that fight. So I have a few questions for you. For the two of you, miss Mann, um, you testified about how the union contributed to the culture in your workplace. Um, could you tell us the best is not the right word? The worst examples in the communication of anti-semitic tropes or conspiracy theories in in the multitude of things that you've gone through, I would say that the posters that said from the 

[11:26:45 AM]

river to the sea were definitely the worst of what I saw. Or how do you interpret from the river to the sea? What does that mean to you? Um, to me, that means it's a call for the destruction of Israel, for the elimination of Israel, for the elimination of Jews. Um, and I interpreted that as them calling for my removal from existence. And by the way, you would not be wrong in having that view. That's exactly what it means. Because if you look at places where those folks have taken over, the best example, for example, is Bethlehem. When it was under Israeli control, it was 85% Christian, and now it is 10% today. So that's a part of from the river to the sea that they have taken control of. And they have endeavored to effectively launch a genocide of those who are not like them. So it's you've accurately described what's going on, Mr. Rubenstein, in your written testimony, you included an attachment, a petition that Cornell graduate students signed to express opposition to Cornell, entering 

[11:27:45 AM]

into a union shop agreement with the graduate student union. Half the students who signed the petition signed it anonymously. Um, they did not put they put their academic department, but they did not put their name. Um, why do you think so many students signed that petition anonymously? Yes. So I actually signed that petition anonymously myself in early 2024. The reason being, after students began signing that petition, the union dispatched its agents to meet with friends, with colleagues of signatories in order to turn those closest to them against them. The union is engaging in this targeted personal harassment of anyone who publicly stands against them. Um, and many people simply did not feel comfortable exposing themselves so that an institution that wants to parade around talking about academic freedom and let's all, you know, peace, love and talk. You're saying that graduate students not like, not like 18 year old freshmen, but graduate students did not feel like they could put their own name on a 

[11:28:48 AM]

petition without facing harassment from those behind Muslim terror. Um, Cornell cannot claim to support academic freedom when it lets its students be harassed for expressing their views. Um, and when it additionally forces students to support an ideological organization. So we know we know why the unions do this. We've talked a lot about it today. Why do you think in your in your case, Mr. Rubenstein, why do you think Cornell puts up with it? I mean, why do they allow it? Um, Cornell knows that this is wrong. Uh, president Michael kotlikoff actually put out a very strong statement against mandatory dues, which is weak as a violation of academic freedom. Um, but ultimately, Cornell is responsive to public pressure. After the union threatened to strike, president kotlikoff reneged on his promises to protect us. Um, and I think that public pressure is the only thing that will change. Force Cornell to change course now. Well, public pressure or the law. I think this committee under chair Wahlberg has made clear that we're coming for the universities that will not protect their jewish students. And maybe Cornell will find themselves in your seat, uh, here in the not too distant 

[11:29:49 AM]

future. I don't know, but I again, I'm angry for you. Um, I have two jewish children, too, and, uh. And I know what it's like to go through what you all have gone through myself, having dealt with it my whole life. Uh, I'm sorry we have failed you to solve the problem, but. But rest assured, there are me and my colleagues who are determined to get to the bottom of it and put an end to this scourge. So thank you for being here. And, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. The gentleman yields back. The chair recognizes ranking member desaulnier for five minutes. Actually, I would defer to Mr. Owens and wait my turn. The chair recognizes representative Owens for five minutes. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. I appreciate convening this hearing today on anti-semitism. And I want to thank the witnesses for for coming here to testify. Uh, I just want to start off by saying that Utah is a right to work state. It's also one of the most attractive states in the union, uh, because unions there know they have to compete for their people to pay them if they are 

[11:30:50 AM]

anti-semitic as semitism, or if they are anti-black or whatever, then we just don't. They don't pay and they don't survive. So that's a very good to bring, very good thing to bring in the competition piece of this. Uh, it is really disgusting that some unions are spending their time advancing anti-semite and anti-Israel priorities instead of addressing the immediate needs of their members. Imagine if these same unions would have advocate for issues that actually impact the well-being of their members, all their members, instead paying paying for the support of hateful leftist politicians or politics. I hope that these union leaders are watching and get the message. Do your job. Stop the anti-semitic activity among your ranks. You're paid a very good salary to protect your members against hate. You're failing to do so now, and your cowardly silence is deafening. So let me just start off, uh, Mr. Mr. Chairman, I just want to ask you real quickly. Um, I know you've been addressing this a little bit already. Uh, the way it's set up right now, if there was a union that was, uh, run by kkk supporters, uh, 

[11:31:53 AM]

the way it's set up right now, would I be forced, if I work for that company, to pay these kkk, uh, folks to, uh, continue moving on? Is that the way it's set up at this point? Do I have a way of getting out of that? Well, that is the way that you would have to pay if you weren't in a right to work state. If you're in the 25 or so states that have forced unionism and you have a kkk union, you'll pay them or you'll be fired. Yes, you could try to exercise beck rights. Yes, you might be able to try to exercise title seven rights, but the bottom line is the default position is pay that union or you will be fired. And it's amazing that those who are pro-hamas who are nothing but kkk feel they have the right to demand people paying them when they hate them. It's amazing to see that we're having this in 2025. We're having this conversation. Mr. Rubenstein, you mentioned, um, uh, requesting religious accommodation. Can you kind of 

[11:32:54 AM]

go through that process you mentioned? You mentioned that it was very frustrating. You couldn't get. But what? Tell me. Tell us what that looked like for you to try to get something, uh, in this in this process done upon contract ratification, Cornell university promised that I could religiously object by doing no more than ticking a box on a form. And yet that form never materialized. And instead I needed to beg union officials for permission to object by writing a highly personal letter detailing private information that's none of their business. And even after I did that, they demanded further intrusive information that they have absolutely no right to. At which point I decided that if I did not want to pay the union, I had no choice but to file legal charges against them. That is not the ticking a box on a form that Cornell promised. Well, I'm going to going to give my time. We give it back. But I just want to say this, uh, we're in 2025. I'm so thankful we have a president. We have a body now that understands this, and we're going to have the right people sitting in front of us explaining why, uh, allowing unions to hate their, 

[11:33:56 AM]

their folks and continue to survive, how that how that happens in 2025. So thank you guys for for being here before us. And we're going to again, continue to follow up on this on this conversation big time. And I yield back. I thank the gentleman for yielding. And now I'll call on the ranking member desaulnier for his questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the witnesses and Mr. Mann and miss Rubenstein. Uh, as a very pro labor person, uh, and as someone who was a member of the teamsters and the afl-cio, uh, I am appalled at what happened to you. And I would love to discuss it individually if you'd care to. Um, Mr. Mccartin, uh, I could spend more than five minutes. We'll talk later, but the history is. Santayana said those who forget history are condemned to repeat it. This is a pattern. So if we want to talk about unions as a countervailing institution, I'm particularly interested. I have a chart I use regularly at town halls, reflecting what you said about union membership and opportunity in this country. In 

[11:34:56 AM]

the middle class, they track evenly. Um, Samuel gompers, I have talked about this just because as someone who loves teddy Roosevelt, uh, there gompers showing teddy Roosevelt the tenements not far from his house as a son of privilege. And that instance where Roosevelt switched from being a Harvard son of a this caste system in America to understanding what it was like to live in those kind of environments, and how that changed the American union movement. So talk a little bit about we could easily be having a hearing right now. Uh, with all due respect about the business community and anti-semitism in corporate boardrooms. But let's talk about the context of why unions are important for equality. Could you give us a little framework on why it's so important and how, uh, people like Samuel gompers, not just him. And you alluded to this in your you didn't allude to it. You mentioned it in your opening comments that they were part of the fabric of creating a strong middle class. And 

[11:35:58 AM]

without them, uh, jewish Americans and the labor movement, we wouldn't have had the American middle class that now is under attack. Again, we're the second coming of the gilded age, which created that moment of history in southern Manhattan when gompers took teddy Roosevelt to the cigar manufacturers. Thank you. Congressman. Yes. What unions did is they brought diverse workers together to give them bargaining power. And that is what built the middle class that you're talking about. To do that, they had to bring diverse people together to do it. They often face being caricatured in the way we've heard today as they attempted to do that. Um, for example, the idea of unions as an outside agitator, um, Samuel gompers was often called that, um, the idea that unions are somehow disconnected, that they are union bosses. You know, it's it's been a lot of, uh, energy talking about the united 

[11:36:58 AM]

electrical workers here today, Mr. Rubinstein, Mr. Taubman together had 255 pages of testimony about the. You. Not once in those 255 pages did the name Carl Rosen appear. Who is Carl Rosen? He's the son of a jewish worker. He leads that union now, and he's being attacked here as a supporter of hamas. I would urge anybody in this committee to go to the website of the united electrical workers and see if they endorse and embrace hamas since Samuel gompers time, and you will find that they don't since Samuel gompers time. This is the kind of attack labor has faced. Mr. Taubman has told you for 43 years he's fought unions. He says these unions are not your father's labor unions. He didn't like our father's labor unions, either. He was fighting them 43 years ago. Then he 

[11:38:00 AM]

might not have been talking about anti-semitism. Now he is at the very moment that he's, uh, bringing these cases forward. He's also bringing another case forward, uh, Cornell, of a student who's not alleging anti-semitism at all, but just does not believe that they should be in a graduate student union. Mr. Taubman at one point said that Samuel gompers said unions ought to be voluntary. Samuel gompers might have. If you pull that out of context somewhere, said something like that. But he fought his whole life for the idea of a union shop being a very American thing. That was what he was dedicated to. And so to portray him in this way, to caricature him into caricature, so many of the people we've we've heard caricatured here, it breaks faith with that image you're talking about. Congressman gompers enlightening Roosevelt. Um, we need a little bit more 

[11:39:01 AM]

of that kind of enlightenment, I would say. I just conclude by the observation of somebody who's a proud californian, the fourth largest economy in the world, that is very strongly union. Um, over 65% of the us gdp comes from states that aren't right to work states. I yield back. The gentleman yields. Now I will, uh, call on miss Stefanik from New York for your questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to direct my questions to miss Kyle Koppelman. Uh, regarding the concerning rise of anti-semitism in certain union organizations in New York state. Um, give me one moment here. Last week, a group of jewish educators rallied outside their union headquarters in New York City. The members of the uft, an affiliate of the of nysut, aft and the nea, were rightfully upset that the union 

[11:40:02 AM]

called an emergency meeting to vote to endorse candidate zoran mamdani. They felt Mr. Mamdani support of the term, quote, globalized the intifada is anti-semitic and anti-zionist. Correctly, while the educators were at the rally, aft president Randi Weingarten was at a rally right down the street with Mr. Mamdani. Considering the union members opposition and the recent rise of national anti-semitism our unions required to make political endorsements, no, unions are not required to make political endorsements, and it's inappropriate for them to do so. And Mr. Glenn Taubman, I wanted to ask your response to that. No, they're not required to. And in the current world that we live in, it's divisive and hateful to support hamas and communist antisemites like Mr. Mamdani. Is there any mechanism today for jewish teachers to opt out of paying dues to unions that support, uh, anti-semitic causes? And if not, how is that remotely 

[11:41:03 AM]

constitutional, Mr. Taubman so for public sector employees like the New York City teachers, they're covered by the Janus ruling, which says you have a right as a matter of free speech and association, to not pay the union, but for private sector employees, if they're not in a right to work state, they can be forced to pay or be fired. And it would be nice to apply Janus to the private sector, where private people's constitutional rights could also be protected. Do you believe that unions like the nea and aft are functioning as ideological enforcement arms, rather than neutral labor advocates, especially in their treatment of pro-Israel educators? So I've been at this for 43 years. When I started, I used to say unions were representatives who did politics on the side. Now they're a political powerhouse. Parties that do a little collective bargaining on the 

[11:42:04 AM]

side. And that's what the nea and the aft and unions like that are all about. It's all about power and money to them. And the collective bargaining is a secondary thing to their political power and their money. Thank you, I yield back. Gentlelady yields back. And I believe that is the conclusion of our questions. And, uh. I call on Mr. Sonier to, uh, to give his closing comments. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And again, I want to just, uh, say that we're I am happy to work with you. If we really want to approach, um, anti-semitism in any institution or field in a serious, serious way. And that is not to diminish the comments from Mr. Mann and Mr. Rubenstein. Right. Today, uh, it's crucial to emphasize that combating anti-semitism transcends or should transcend political divisions. It's moral 

[11:43:06 AM]

imperative that it's a moral imperative that demands unwavering commitment from all Americans. However, as doctor Mccartin noted in his testimony, quote, the historical record clearly shows that the labor movement has been a bastion of opposition to anti-semitism through its modern history and remain so today. Close quote America's union movement not only uplifts workers who have been left behind, but also gives all workers the power to hire wages, better benefits and safer workplaces that benefits everybody in America, including employers. At the time of great economic inequality, where life is unaffordable for millions and millions of working families, we should be working to strengthen workers union rights and ensure all their rights are made reality, and make sure that cases that have been brought up today about antisemitism or hate in any institutions are dealt with directly and forcefully. 

[11:44:08 AM]

Unfortunately, since returning to office, president trump has attacked workers rights to organize and undermine the agency's intended to protect them. And in closing, I just want to end with a quote from Samuel gompers. You can tell I'm a fan, he said. What does labor want? We want more school houses and less jails, more books and less arsenals, more learning and less vice, more leisure and less greed, more justice and less revenge. Mr. Chairman, I yield back. I thank the ranking member. Um, with that, I will issue a closing statement as well. Um, we are living in different times, uh, today, uh, appreciate the history of, uh, all the great history of our country. Uh, but 

[11:45:08 AM]

unfortunately, our country is very divided today. And, uh, from a standpoint of history, as I said earlier, this goes back thousands of years. The battle rages on. And, um, you know, god will deal with this. Uh, I want to thank our witnesses for sharing their experiences and perspectives on unions. Formenting anti-semitism. Uh, today's hearing makes it clear that our labor laws must respect the choices of jewish workers and workers who do not support their union's actions and political, uh, priorities. Unions are no longer a bastion of fighting discrimination. That is clear by this testimony today. Uh, no worker in America should have to pay dues to a union that celebrates violence against Jews or any other group, and seeks the destruction of Israel to keep a to get or keep their job. You have to be kidding me. Really? As 

[11:46:11 AM]

witnesses testified today, the nlrb should implement policies that allow employers to protect their jewish employees at work and that free graduate students from the tyranny of anti-semitic unions. Unions should not be allowed to place additional burdens on employees seeking exemption from funding the union's political or hateful activities. My state of Georgia is a right to work state. That means that you do not have to pay union jobs, to hold your dues to to to hold your pay, union dues, to hold your job. Uh, unions should be required to represent all their members fairly, even those who have different political or religious views. I look forward to working with the members of this subcommittee and the administration to advance the freedom of dignity of workers in America and shield jewish workers from hate and harassment at work. And I will say this, this administration is the pro worker 

[11:47:11 AM]

administration. Uh, again, that has changed drastically. And we will continue to fight for workers and against anti-semitic or any other hateful activity. Thank you. And I yield to thank you to our witnesses. Um, and again, for your time and testimony in the subcommittee today. Uh, without objection, there being no further business, the subcommittee stands adjourned. Thank you.

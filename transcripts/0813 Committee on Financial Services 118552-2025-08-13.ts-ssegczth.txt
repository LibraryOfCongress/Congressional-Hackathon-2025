Speaker 1 [10:00:12 AM]
Illicit finance and international finance institutions will come to order. Without objection, the chairman is authorized to declare a recess of the committee at any time. Today's hearing is titled Securing the Supply Chain, the Defense Production Act in Focus. While objection, all members will have 5 legislative days within which to submit extraneous materials for inclusion in the record. I now recognize myself for 4 minutes for an opening statement. Good morning and welcome to today's National Security Subcommittee hearing, securing the supply chain, the Defense Protection Act in focus, which is devoted to evaluating the Defense Protection Act ahead of its expiration in September. This year, this subcommittee has had, uh, a June hearing and a July briefing that provided fundamental overview of DPA for members of

Speaker 2 [10:00:59 AM]
Congress.

Speaker 1 [10:01:00 AM]
We convene here today at Wright Patterson Air Force Base because of its significance in implementing DPA's Title I I through Right Path's hosting of major Air Force commands involved in defense acquisition.

Speaker 2 [10:01:13 AM]
This

Speaker 1 [10:01:13 AM]
ensures that Title II funded defense, uh, funded capabilities are integrated into operational systems. It affects the base's sustainment activities and enhances its ability to address national industrial-based vulnerabilities. My colleagues and I are grateful for the opportunity to address the critical role of Wright Patterson Air Force Base in executing DPA's Title III authorities and the urgent need to modernize and enhance these powers to strengthen our national

Speaker 2 [10:01:40 AM]
security

Speaker 1 [10:01:41 AM]
We will feature two panels, the first offering military officials perspective on the current DPA functionality. In the second panel incorporating feedback from civilian defense contractors from our region on today's procurement landscape enacted in 1950 during the Korean War, DPA was designed to secure America's industrial base for national emergencies, prioritizing domestic production over foreign reliance. Today is our dependence on foreign critical materials, semiconductors, rare materials pharmaceuticals, uh, gross, the DPA's importance is undeniable. However, from 2018 to 2014, 2024, uh there's been a significant change in the pace of, uh, some of the Title II activity. COVID-19 pandemic exposed a reactive posture, uh, provi proving that waiting for a crisis results in a delayed response, and, and not always well thought out. Modernizing DPA demands a proactive approach to bolster domestic capabilities, right? Pat is central to addressing these challenges through the Air Force Research Lab's executive agent program office Right Pa manages Title II projects to expand manufacturing capacity. uh for advanced materials, but also for um older technologies and

Speaker 2 [10:03:02 AM]
uh

Speaker 1 [10:03:03 AM]
nevertheless, limitations persist, streamlining the DPA process could enable faster agreements and expand flexible contracting. Increasing funding flexibility would allow Right Pat to prioritize emerging technologies as well as uh improving existing supply chains. Reauthorizing DPA offers a chance to reset and realign its authorities with today's threats. By enhancing right past roll through simplified procurement, expanded funding, and proactive collaboration, we can rebuild a rein a more resilient industrial base. I urge, uh, this committee to consider an

Speaker 2 [10:03:45 AM]
opportunity

Speaker 1 [10:03:48 AM]
I urge this committee to reconsider the defense Protection Act and the opportunity we have before us to modernize it.

Speaker 2 [10:03:55 AM]
that

Speaker 1 [10:03:59 AM]
I would now yield my time and I will recognize the chairman of the full committee, French Hill for one

Speaker 2 [10:04:05 AM]
minute They had 4 minutes on the

Speaker 1 [10:04:08 AM]
Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's great to be here in your home state of

Speaker 3 [10:04:11 AM]
Ohio and here at Wright Patterson with our

Speaker 2 [10:04:14 AM]
colleagues

Speaker 3 [10:04:16 AM]
America's navigating one of the most dangerous and complex global threat environments in recent history.

Speaker 2 [10:04:21 AM]
Our

Speaker 3 [10:04:21 AM]
adversaries were accelerating innovation, scaling production, and heavily investing in their national defense capabilities. It's critical that America keeps pace and expands our dominance as the leader in the free world. That requires not just military might but economic resilience, financial agility, and industrial strength. During today's field hearing, we'll explore ways to use the Defense Production Act to secure supply chains and strengthen our domestic industrial base, while ensuring that our federal agencies have the tools they need to meet 21st century threats, threats. The DPA needs to be anchored in its strategic goals embedded in the Truman administration, but be modernized, reorganized, and focused for these 21st century challenges. I thank Chairman Davidson for his leadership on our subcommittee and look forward to today's discussion. Are you

Speaker 2 [10:05:10 AM]
back.

Speaker 1 [10:05:12 AM]
Thanks, Chairman Hill. Today we will divide our witnesses into two panels for the first panel, we welcome the testimony

Speaker 2 [10:05:17 AM]
of

Speaker 1 [10:05:17 AM]
Mr. Jeffrey Frankston, the acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base resilience at the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial-based policy. Uh, also Dr. Charles Ormsby, acting director of the Materials and Manufacturing Directate, Directorate at Air Force Research Laboratory. We thank you both for taking time to be here. Uh, you will each be recognized for 5 minutes to give an oral presentation of your testimony. Without objection, your written statements will be made part of the record. Mr. Frank, Mr. Frankston, you're now recognized for 5 minutes for your oral statement. Thank you, sir.

Speaker 4 [10:05:54 AM]
Uh, Chairman Hill, uh, Vice Chairman, uh, committee chairman Hanga subcommittee Chairman Davidson, Representative Moore, uh, good morning. Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today on the critical role of the Defense Production Act plays in ensuring the United States maintains the industrial strength needed to support the interim National Defense Strategic guidance and sustain its competitive edge. It's an honor to speak to you for this aviation geek in this facility to talk about the industrial base and building back to where we need to be. Um unlike some of the airplanes in this facility, the DPA is not a Cold War relic. It is a vital statutory tool, one that enables the department to identify and respond to industrial shortfalls, reinforce supply chain integrity and resilience and accelerate production in support of urgent operational needs. In an era where geopolitical competition is intensifying, particularly from China, industrial capacity remains a key determinant of our deterrence. We continue to see challenges that test our industrial resilience, and we have seen renewed cyberattacks targeting US aerospace and shipbuilding firms, expanded Chinese restrictions on exports of critical minerals and mounting cost pressures on cross-defense manufacturing. Our shipyards are overburdened. Our munition suppliers are operating at maximum throughput, but still still falling short of sharp surge demands. These challenges are cumulative and compounding, and they demand more than reactive procurement. They require flexibility and coordination between government and industry and the DPA provides that and more. Revi tal izing the defense industrial base's foundational to restoring deterrences and rebuilding our military. Under this administration's leadership, we are executing a deliberate data-driven strategy to rebuild US defense production capacity and shore up domestic supply chains. We're leveraging key authorities like DPA Title III to address fragile nodes across priority sectors like munitions and strategic and critical minerals. We have reduced barriers to entry through to expand participation in the defense industrial base for small businesses and non-traditional vendors through operational, uh, through other transactional authorities, flexible acquisition vehicles and improved acquisition guidance, we are fostering competition and accelerating innovation. These vehicles offer a unique ability to scale the department's efforts to force foster competition and collaboration between the government, traditional businesses and non-traditional vendors. Efforts like this are about more than improving industrial capacity. They are part and parcel to ensuring a resilient, responsive, and adequately distributed defense complex cap able of meeting both wartime demands and maintaining a credible military posture that effectively deters our adversaries. The DOD uses the DPA every day in our mission to safeguard vital US national interests. Title I, you authorizes the president to require industry to accept and prioritize contracts and orders to promote the national defense. We leveraged the Title I authorities for priority capabilities, including long range fires, integrated missile defense and replenishment of critical munitions. We are taking active steps to continue to improve the defense priorities and allocation system, including clearer onboarding guidance for new suppliers, rapid internal approval processes and streamline compliance mechanisms for small and mid-sized vendors. Title II is a force multiplier where market dynamics alone are insufficient to ensure our domestic industrial base has the capabilities we need for national defense. In fiscal years 2020 through 2024, approximately $2.8 billion was awarded to 194 projects under this program. So far, in FY 25, the program's made awards totaling more than 500 million, and these investments are complemented by 88 million in total recipient cost shares since the beginning of the fiscal year. There are these investments go uh just a sample go towards restoring critical chemical production, expanding domestic manufacturing for solid rocket motors, establishing secure supply chains for strategic and critical minerals and materials, and in concert with our allies and partners. Um, these investments are also designed to improve economic viability where sustained demand is critical to maintaining a healthy market and resilient industrial base. Title VII is a key enabler of investment screening and supply chain protection. Um, the department co-leads approximately 6% of all committee on Foreign Investment in the United States or CIFIUS reviews, uh, and has referred more than 75 non-notified transactions just in the past year. These authorities allow us to identify and present and prevent adversarial capital from gaining control over sensitive production pathways. The recent expansion of CIFIus review over more real estate sites is a good first step, but we need to build on this foundation.

Speaker 2 [10:10:33 AM]
The

Speaker 4 [10:10:33 AM]
Department strongly supports full role reauthorization of the DPA. Let me close by underscoring that deterrence is built long before the potential for conflict emerges. It is built in our factories, on our shop floors, and in the continuity of our supply chains, the DPA is how we turn strategic priorities into industrial reality. It's how we ensure our warfighters are not waiting for parts, materials, or reads itself. I look forward to your questions and continued collaboration in this shared mission.

Speaker 1 [10:10:58 AM]
Thank you, Mr. Frankston. Mr. Ormsby or Doctor Ormsby, you are now recognized for 5 minutes for your oral statement. Subcommittee Chairman Davidson, uh, Committee Chairman Hill, Vice Chairman Hazinga, and Representative Moore, good morning.

Speaker 5 [10:11:11 AM]
Uh, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I'm happy to speak regarding the Defense Protection Act Title III program. I will discuss the executive agent program office, uh, our role, our history, and the status in executing the Defense Protection Act Title II.

Speaker 2 [10:11:28 AM]
I

Speaker 5 [10:11:28 AM]
serve as the acting director of the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate within the Air Force Research Laboratory headquartered here at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. And in this position, I lead the Defense Protection Act Title III executive Agent Program Office. The executive agent Program Office is staffed by a multi-disciplinary team, including program managers, scientists, engineers, national environmental policy experts, uh, purchase agreements, specialist, financial managers, and other subject matter experts required to execute often complex and unique projects. The executive agent program office is central to the practical execution of Defense Protection Act Title III investments for the Department of Defense. While the executive agent Program Office manages the operational and technical aspects, the projects are authorized and funded by the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment. Specifically, the manufacturing capability expansion and investment prioritization directorate within industrial - ba s ed policy is responsible for the Title III program and its funding. This organizational structure indicates a clear division of labor with industrial-based policy providing the strategic guidance and financial oversight and the materials and manufacturing directorate that I represent, serving as the primary technical and execution arm. I'm pleased to have Mr. Jeffrey Frankston, acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Industrial-based Resilience, joining me today. The executive agent program Office initiates project solicitations through a funding opportunity announcement. We issued a hybrid funding opportunity announcement in July of 2019, which allows for both unsolicited inputs from industry and government-initiated calls for specific proposals addressing vetted requirements. We are also executing other transactions using a Washington headquarters Services procurement vehicle. We are executing 109 technical invest ment agreements from the funding opportunity announcement. Additionally, we are processing one other transaction, prototype award, that will include project management support, and we are providing purchase agreement, agreements officer representative and project management support for an additional other transactions to be awarded by the Washington headquarters Services. The executive agent Program Office executes from 6 funds, including core Title $3 CARES Act supplemental, Ukraine supplemental inflation reduction Act, Indo-Pacific Security Supplemental and Israel Security supplemental. These funds have varying structures. For some funds, obligation and expenditures have no expiration dates. For others, there are expiration dates stated. The executive agent program offices diverse staff of engineers and scientists are proud to provide critical technical depth for assessing industrial-based capabilities and ensuring investments achieve a resilient defense industrial base Notably, recent examples include a project that's significantly improved production of gallium nitride, monolithic microwave integrated circuits, achieving a threefold yield improvement at a 76% cost reduction. Another project expanded domestic nickel production, identifying the purest nickel in the United States and perhaps globally. The purity was so good examples were placed in the Smithsonian just last week. Our expertise extends to managing pro projects across critical chemicals, critical minerals and materials, hypersonics, radiation hardened microelectronics, castings and forgings, and energy storage and battery value chains. The executive agent Program Office employs over 60 government civilians and contractors to support the program in full-time and part-time positions. Executive agent Program Office personnel benefit from a strategic understanding of their technical fields that extends to science and technology projects. They support outside of the Title III program. This enables our team to initiate materials and manufacturing technology programs of great value to the Department of Defense. The materials and manufacturing Directorate through the executive agent program office takes pride in our 33 years securing the Defense Industrial base for our nation. I thank you for the opportunity to testify today, and I look forward to your questions.

Speaker 1 [10:15:59 AM]
Thank you, Doctor Ormsby. Um We'll now turn to a number of questions, and

Speaker 2 [10:16:05 AM]
so

Speaker 1 [10:16:07 AM]
um, I'll recognize myself for 5 minutes. Um you know, Mr. Frankston, you highlighted really the three titles that are functional and you look just by structure Title 1, Title II, and Title VII, that'll tell you it's gone some undergone some revisions, um, for the most part it's been deletions and not additions over the years, but you know, title Title I, uh, for simplicity prioritization, Title II, uh, for investments and title VI for screening. I, I wonder if you could highlight, uh, particularly an example maybe a cost share example of how you're deploying capital to address a DPA priority for the supply chain and how that works, you know, how do you screen for it? How do you decide to make the investment? What does that work? How does that work out? You highlighted 88 million that you're deploying in the market, maybe one of those projects that uh is addressing a critical shortage.

Speaker 4 [10:17:08 AM]
Sir, thank you very much for the question. Um

Speaker 2 [10:17:11 AM]
The

Speaker 4 [10:17:11 AM]
DPA gives us flexibilities to attack a number of different key priority areas. Um, one of those, uh, that we've been focusing on intently of late is a critical and strategic minerals and materials, given some of the supply chain challenges that have been highlighted due to Chinese export restrictions and controls. Um, we have recently put out a couple of projects just in the last few weeks, uh, but previously to those we have a number of projects where we

Speaker 2 [10:17:41 AM]
give just a

Speaker 4 [10:17:41 AM]
little bit of dollars with DPA and that comes to a call share either from a private equity or venture capital for those projects. A lot of times we are just giving a signaling to the company to show that we have a sustained interest in this priority capability or mineral in this particular case, and that is what these companies are needing for their own investments or to get outside banking help and support to sustain their critical mineral production.

Speaker 1 [10:18:08 AM]
Yes, thank you for that, and you highlight critical minerals and obviously that's a, uh, uh, a shortage for the country. It's a crisis, not just for the defense supply chain, but maybe more broadly. And given that this is the first time we're updating, um, DPA post-COVID. Maybe you could talk about some of the other areas that you look at in terms of prioritization or investment in, you know, healthcare, pharmaceuticals, other sectors that, that maybe are on your radar

Speaker 2 [10:18:35 AM]
screen.

Speaker 4 [10:18:36 AM]
So thank you. Um, our current priorities are uh critical minerals, uh, missiles and munitions are at the top of our list. Uh, there are many other sectors where we have critical shortfalls in our defense industrial base. Uh, minerals and materials are at the basis and the fundamental nature of everything that we do. If we do not have a particular mineral, it doesn't matter if we have 95% of all the other ones for a particular weapons system.

Speaker 2 [10:19:05 AM]
we're

Speaker 4 [10:19:05 AM]
still short because of that requirement. And so that has our direct key focus and attention, missiles and munitions are, are direct way to project force and enable capability. And so we have challenges, uh, be it to meet the needs that our nation demands for the conflicts and the adversaries that we may face. And so we are deploying our capital, deploying DPA to get after key shortfalls to expand capacity ahead of a conflict so that we are not short once the balloon goes up.

Speaker 1 [10:19:35 AM]
Ed, thank you. I mean, you know, it's an adaptation of a different quote, but you know, you go to supply, go to war with the supply chain you have, not the one you wish you had, right? And, uh, you know, Doctor Ormsby, you've highlighted both cutting-edge technology and then, you know, more mature technologies like castings and forgings, and I wonder if you could highlight in your work how you balance those needs to really meet, uh, you know, the national security threats

Speaker 2 [10:20:00 AM]
that that

Speaker 1 [10:20:01 AM]
we need to address.

Speaker 5 [10:20:02 AM]
Yes, sir, thank you for the, the question. Um, I would say that first off, it is absolutely a partnership with Mr. Frankston. He sets the priorities we execute the programs, so he sets the the balance of the portfolio, uh, but we do have a number of, of projects in the, the last several years that have focused on castings and forgings for navy applications for Air Force applications, um, as, as well as I, I said, you know, balance across microelectronics needs hypersonics needs, you name it, uh, really set by the, the priorities coming out of OSD and then we go out and work with the industry partners to actually execute the programs.

Speaker 1 [10:20:45 AM]
Yeah, thank you and um not only is, is right Pat central to the capability to run uh procurement and the materials command, the cutting edge procurement at AFRL. We also have capability at a threat assessment and so it was nice to bring some colleagues in and highlight the capabilities here at Right Pa. So again, thanks to the team for hosting. Uh, I'll yield my time and now recognize Chairman Hill, uh, Mr. French Hill is the chairman of the full committee and represents an area of Little Rock, Arkansas.

Speaker 5 [10:21:17 AM]
Uh,

Speaker 3 [10:21:18 AM]
thanks for both of you being with us today and greetings from Little Rock Air Force Base in the 19th Air Wing in Little Rock, to everybody here at Right Pat, um, Mr. Frankston, let me start with you. Looking at Title I just on the priority setting. I'm a business guy, so I'm gonna ask a pretty obvious question, which is if everything gets a priority rating. What's a priority?

Speaker 4 [10:21:40 AM]
It's a great question, sir. Thank you very much for the opportunity to answer. So we spend a lot of time working with the services, hearing from industry about the prioritization uh uh matrix. All DOD orders are generally given a higher priority just to compete against civilian markets to ensure that we get the weapons and the capabilities that we need, but we work daily with our services and our industry counterparts to be responsive when an issue is raised, when there's a conflict, uh, on a particular priorit ization uh, that in and of itself giving it a priority rating doesn't solve the issue if there's still a challenge in the supply chain itself. That's where DPA, Title II, and the other uh authorities that we have to go resource that supply chain, come in, but we will flag it and raise it for attention, and these have our highest priority to be responsive when a bottleneck is raised.

Speaker 3 [10:22:31 AM]
Does that mean that you really have a super priority system that should we, should the DPA processed should the advisory council, for example you,

Speaker 2 [10:22:41 AM]
you.

Speaker 3 [10:22:41 AM]
you know, set DOD priorities,

Speaker 2 [10:22:43 AM]
but

Speaker 3 [10:22:44 AM]
you have a different grade that's a step above that one. There's a bottleneck and it's a DPA priority and make that distinction so that instead of 2.5 million uh priorities over the last 5 years that they're, you know, fewer that are directly related to the specific benefits of Title III, for

Speaker 4 [10:23:03 AM]
example, sir, there's two ways we approach this. Um, so one is we have something called the DX rating. It does not actually stand for anything, but that is our highest prior ity systems. And so there's a handful of those because uh to your point, there is only so many silver bullets that you could spend from a prioritization, but these are given to our most sensitive, critical, uh, urgent capabilities, and so they do have a little bit of a step above the rest. Alternatively, we also have within Title I something called Special priorities, uh, allocations where we work down at the lower component level. So where we find that there's a bottleneck or a key, uh, widget or item that is um a choke point in supporting multiple programs. We can work to prioritize that, work with the services, work with the industry, and then if necessary, given a capacity shortfall or other challenge, we then would deploy DPA Title III to

Speaker 2 [10:23:54 AM]
help.

Speaker 3 [10:23:55 AM]
So in Title Title II, if you look back over the past 5 years it has been very active. What's the civil service and contractor breakdown in your chain of command.

Speaker 4 [10:24:05 AM]
So we have a very small but highly skilled and empowered team. I only have a handful of people on our side, and it's similar I would think with uh with the with AFRL, um, I have one DPA Title III manager. Um, I have a couple other civilians that are assisting. I have one deep pass, so our prioritization manager. We have several billets that we're trying to fill, and then we have uh a handful of contractors behind that with the support from the Congress and our administration leadership. We have support to expand that, but it's necessary to manage the breadth and scope of both the program and then the challenge in front of us.

Speaker 3 [10:24:44 AM]
Well, given the pressure on the supply chain from the current conflicts around the world that you've talked about in your opening statements and then

Speaker 2 [10:24:51 AM]
this

Speaker 3 [10:24:53 AM]
uh existential threat to reshore or friend shore our strategic needs that are so competitive. How many additional staff do you think you need that would accelerate the application processing. and how do you quantify the, what is, what is the right speed on application processing.

Speaker 4 [10:25:11 AM]
Thank you for the question, uh, Chairman. Uh, we feel that at least 2 more civilians for each of the programs in prior and uh uh titles would be useful. We are conscious of not becoming a large staff that adds bureaucracy to the process, but a couple of trained skilled civilians. Luckily we have support for our leadership to move out on this, um, and then what's the requisite contractor support, but then also we rely on the partnership with our services, uh, like AFRL, but then all the other military services who are helping us evaluate, assess, and ensure that when we make an investment or plan to make an investment that there is a receiving end of that investment, whether through an industry partner or a program office to ensure that that investment is worthwhile.

Speaker 3 [10:25:56 AM]
Good. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'll go back and look forward to the second round.

Speaker 1 [10:26:00 AM]
Thank you, Mr. Hill. I now recognize the vice chairman of the full committee, Mr. Hazinga, who represents Western Michigan.

Speaker 5 [10:26:07 AM]
Uh, thank you. both Chairman Davidson, Chairman Hill, uh, I appreciate the opportunity to be down here, um, I, uh, I actually represent uh the Battle Creek Air National Guard facility up in Battle Creek. We had a briefing earlier with someone from the 110th Airwing, and I just want to say uh thank you and extend my gratitude to them. They, they operate the MQ-1s 9s, uh, out of uh out of Battle Creek and obviously, uh, that is part of the portfolio. that we're we're talking about here. Um I want to try to touch on a couple of, uh, of things, uh, might seem a little disjointed, but

Speaker 2 [10:26:49 AM]
I and

Speaker 5 [10:26:51 AM]
based on some experience that we had had,

Speaker 6 [10:26:53 AM]
um, uh, previously going through reworking of Sifius. Uh, I'd like to know more about specifically from Mr. Frankston, uh, how your operations fit into that cieus um operation in that review

Speaker 4 [10:27:11 AM]
Thank you for the question, Vice Chairman. Um, so SIPus is managed by one of our sister offices, uh, so still within the umbrella of, of our industrial-based policy office. We collaborate with them daily, um, the Sifius reviews, they have the lead on how they work with the Department of Commerce and the other uh interaggencies that review each of these um uh potential cases, but a lot of that is informed by where a adversary or foreign partner may make want to make an investment. We need to be aware of that as we're targeting our own supply chains too. It helps us to know where China or another adversary is trying to gain leverage against a key shortfall that we may have or something else. So there is a constant exchange of data, and

Speaker 6 [10:27:55 AM]
typically that had been in manufacturing

Speaker 2 [10:27:58 AM]
space

Speaker 6 [10:27:59 AM]
previously. Now we've sort of expanded into strategic locations, correct, which is, which is literally the review of land and acquisitions that might be outside of either a technical ability or some sort of manufacturing ability, correct?

Speaker 4 [10:28:14 AM]
That is correct, sir. Yes,

Speaker 6 [10:28:15 AM]
OK, and it's appropriate in your view?

Speaker 4 [10:28:17 AM]
Yes, it absolutely is a direct bearing um where our adversaries are, so that land that might be next to a base or that might be next to an industrial facility, uh, is may just be an opportunity for espionage or a different,

Speaker 6 [10:28:31 AM]
probably not just sheer coincidence that the Chinese are interested in picking up land next to

Speaker 4 [10:28:36 AM]
a facility,

Speaker 2 [10:28:37 AM]
yeah.

Speaker 6 [10:28:37 AM]
Uh, OK, uh, I'm gonna, uh track over to Doctor Ormsby here a little bit because I think this is something that as we've gone through um discussions of DPA previously.

Speaker 2 [10:28:49 AM]
uh, kind of famously, at least in Michigan, there was discussion when we saw the the the shortfall in, in ventilators, for example, during COVID, and the supply being cut off by China, there was discussion of implementing DPA to uh to compel our manufacturers to go into that specific manufacturing. um, Ford is my recollection, uh actually voluntarily stepped up

Speaker 6 [10:29:19 AM]
and changed some of their production to be able to fill that. Uh, but that's, that's outside of sort of the traditional role of DPA and certainly what you've been talking about with these, these core 6 funds, uh, you know, the core Title $3 I'm more interested in how you

Speaker 2 [10:29:38 AM]
see,

Speaker 6 [10:29:39 AM]
uh, how the CARES Act supplemental funds, how the inflation reduction Act funds fit into that, and then we see the foreign policy side of this with Ukraine supplemental, the Indo-Pacific Security Supplemental in the Israel Security supplemental Fund. So explain to everybody that might be watching this and certainly for us up here, where you see these different funds and how they fit and you had mentioned there's expiration dates on those, and if you could outline

Speaker 2 [10:30:06 AM]
that.

Speaker 5 [10:30:07 AM]
Yes, uh thank you for the, the question, Vice Chairman. Um, I, I think, uh, a lot of that really does go to to Mr. Frankston, uh, where, where we're setting the priorities within the um legal authorities that we get and the funding authorities that we get, uh, and then in our office, we, we execute the, the, um, priorities basically, um, so I, I would say the, the various funds, um, do apply to, to needs that we have, um, you know, as we look at replenishing munitions, uh, replenishing stocks. It it does, does help. Um, the expiration date, uh, issue that, that you bring up, um, can be a, a bit of a um an execution hindrance for us to, to be honest with you, um, in that, especially as we get large dollar infusions, uh, coming in and um I, I don't want to say unplanned but maybe not uh expected well in advance, right? uh with restrictions on how you can use them, then we have to, to fairly rapidly come up with a strategy, and we have to get those funds on agreements and and issued, which causes us to have to do some, some prioritization of who we're working with, when we're working with them, uh, with our limited staff.

Speaker 6 [10:31:33 AM]
My time's expired, but I look forward to exploring that a bit more, maybe a second round so you

Speaker 1 [10:31:38 AM]
We'll have a second round. I now recognize the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Moore, who's also the former Speaker of the House of the state of North Carolina's House of Representatives Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and, and thank you for hosting us here. This has been

Speaker 3 [10:31:54 AM]
an incredible visit and this is an absolutely amazing facility and an amazing base.

Speaker 1 [10:31:59 AM]
Uh, I'll tell

Speaker 2 [10:31:59 AM]
you, with,

Speaker 6 [10:32:00 AM]
you know, with the continued consolidation of our domestic industrial base. It, it seems to me more important than ever to recognize and support the critical role of our existing industry, uh, like back home in North Carolina, for example, the uh uh we have a lot of companies that contribute greatly to the, you know, supply chain when it comes to national defense. and Shelby, which is actually my home county, we actually have one of the very few, uh, copper smelting and refining facilities in the United States. Uh, there's talk about the availability of, of, you know, rare earth minerals, but you also have to have the capability to, uh to produce those. And so they actually have a facility that produces 100% of copper or pure copper from copper scrap and the Department of Defense of course has identified high purity copper as a strategic metal essential to our national security. So Dr. Worms will be, uh, with copp er uh being DOD's second most utilized material, uh, which China though currently controls, as I understand, 50% of the global smelting capacity. What are the national security consequences when our domestic smelting and refining capabilities lag behind those of our global

Speaker 4 [10:33:07 AM]
competitors.

Speaker 5 [10:33:09 AM]
Sir, thank you for the question. Um, I, I think you're, you're hitting on the, the critical issue, uh, honestly, that Mr. Frankston brought up early on about the priority for critical chemicals, critical minerals, critical materials, uh, we are seeing a number of issues exactly like the one that, that you bring up in our supply chains, particularly down very far into the supply chains, often at uh levels below where our, our prime contractors would even recognize that there is an issue that they can't get that specific material that is necessary uh for our weapons systems, and that's where the priority on the critical chemicals, minerals, materials, uh, really plays into our, our strategy here and, and where we're investing uh because it is a big issue for the department.

Speaker 6 [10:34:04 AM]
So how would you say, you know, export restrictions by other nations affect the ability to refine and produce copper in the US.

Speaker 5 [10:34:13 AM]
Sir, it's, it's obviously a major issue for us. um, and to, to the point, um, it's not just about getting the materials that that we need. It's also about being able to process them, right? And that's, that's why we have uh such a priority on this investment.

Speaker 1 [10:34:29 AM]
So we'll say if another nation were to

Speaker 6 [10:34:33 AM]
manipulate global prices, what actions could the DOD take to safeguard, uh, domestic manufacturing.

Speaker 5 [10:34:42 AM]
Uh, sir, thank you for the question. Would you like to take it or would you like me to answer, sir?

Speaker 4 [10:34:46 AM]
So, uh, thank you very much. I'm happy to uh help. So as uh Doctor Ormsby noted, uh, it's not just at the mine itself, it's not just that the processing itself, it's across the entire supply chain for a critical minerals and materials, and China has absolutely been manipulating the market, has been placing export controls and so that is one of the reasons why we've placed such a high priority is why one of the earliest executive orders from this administration. was on critical minerals. It's why we have a presidential determination to waiver to be able to use DPA for critical minerals and materials across the entire supply chain so that we can rebuild or reinforce our domestic capability and capacity or in the case of uh uh for the mines itself and where these minerals are coming out of the earth, uh, geography matters, and some of this isn't just always not available in the US and so that's why it's leveraging key partners and allies that we can ut il ize uh, certainly at the mine level but then build the processing and the supply chain capabilities internal to the US

Speaker 2 [10:35:48 AM]
and,

Speaker 6 [10:35:48 AM]
and to that point, even beyond metals, I think it's equally important that we be able to identify, for example, and be able to source textiles, you know, that you don't think of textiles a lot of time when you're just talking about national defense, but the ability to have the proper uniforms, the proper material, uh, for our fighting men and women is critical. And of course the Berry amendment requires the DOD to procure textile and clothing products made with nearly 100% US content. It ensures a stable domestic supply chain that will protect us from other nations that seek to manipulate it. So I guess it's kind of a softball question here, but how I mean, how does maintaining, how important is maintaining an independent domestic textile supply chain, improve the resi resiliency in the event of a near pure conflict. And either of you want to take it's

Speaker 4 [10:36:36 AM]
fine. Thank you for the question. It's absolutely critical. It's not just in clothing, those textiles and materials go into our weapons systems themselves too. So we need to have that domestic capability.

Speaker 3 [10:36:47 AM]
Yeah, we're, we're, we're very proud in

Speaker 6 [10:36:49 AM]
North Carolina to have a significant production capacity of textiles.

Speaker 2 [10:36:53 AM]
So, um, yeah, I, I

Speaker 6 [10:36:55 AM]
won't start the fight about being the home of whites since we're in Ohio right

Speaker 2 [10:36:59 AM]
now, but uh

Speaker 6 [10:37:01 AM]
we do have some textiles,

Speaker 2 [10:37:02 AM]
but

Speaker 1 [10:37:02 AM]
I, I think the gentlemen, we'll go ahead and start our second panel now and so I'll I'll recommend our 2nd, uh, 2nd round, not the 2nd panel, 2nd round for this panel, uh, to, to be more precise, uh, so recognize myself for five minutes and um talking about flight, you know, they do have some beautiful real estate in North Carolina, but we do have the engineers here in Ohio, so that I knew it was gonna go there Chapman,

Speaker 6 [10:37:28 AM]
but I did start it

Speaker 1 [10:37:29 AM]
this here in the, in the birthplace of aviation. Um, now the uh the dialogue that with, um Mr. Hazinga, really, I think highlights, you know, the coordination necessary across multiple federal agencies and of course, on, on 7, Article 7 or Title VII, um when you're looking at Cypheus, for example, um, threat assessments, things like that. It's important in Title I, I think Chairman Hill highlighted that, you know, if you've got 100 priorities, you really have zero priorities but is picking up with the dialogue with Mr. Ormsey, how's the collaboration across agencies going within Title II, and when you think about multiple federal agencies, there are times where FEMA is really the lead coordinator. So what's what's the overall office doing uh to kind of coordinate, uh, kind of across agencies

Speaker 2 [10:38:20 AM]
ies

Speaker 1 [10:38:23 AM]
Mr. Mr. Frankson, all right,

Speaker 4 [10:38:24 AM]
thank you very much for the question. So, um there is a monthly working group that uh FEMA hosts for all of the federal agencies that has DPA authorities, um, DOD happens to have the vast majority of actual DOD appropriation or appropriation for DPA, um, but we work hand in hand with our partners. Uh, when we have um

Speaker 2 [10:38:48 AM]
uh

Speaker 4 [10:38:49 AM]
challenges or areas that occur or incidents that occur that cross into one of our other interagency partners. We have a fantastic working relationship where we can reach out to someone like Energy or transportation to identify opportunities to collaborate. Um, this can be strengthened. We could work at an even higher level, at the executive level, more collaboratively, but again, we work across the interagency. I will add in particular on DPA Title I commerce has the lead role and uh we have a phenomenal working relationship with commerce when we get a prioritization when we need their help and request. We turn that quick ourselves and they're turning it back to even quicker to us. So it is a really, really, uh, strong relationship. Yeah,

Speaker 1 [10:39:32 AM]
thank you, and I guess it also highlights the importance of how Congress appropriates money and you know, Dr. Ormsby, you highlighted several buckets that you're actively managing. When you think about not just the appropriations and the status quo that we have, not just in DPA but in the procurement. One of the things the DPA does at times is, uh, you know, sort of bridge the gap between status quo thinking and a lot of times the, the supply chain, uh, functions at least adequately for the status quo. The real question is, when you have those moments of crisis where you have to surge, how resilient is the supply chain? How important is it to maybe use some of what we're learning from DPA to look at the rest of the procurement process or be able to waive even our own procurement process, and I think just to illustrate, uh, you know, Space X out there, you know, gave us deep space launch capability that we were for a while dependent on Russia, you know, Atlas is still under development, using status quo traditional procurement operations, so at a certain level, the supply chain arbitrage was really part of the success story there. So, you know, how do we, how do we make this better?

Speaker 5 [10:40:39 AM]
Yes, Chairman Davidson, thank you for the question. Um, I, I, I think you're hitting on a, a key issue that that we have right now. Um, these authorities can, can really help us to um address supply chain issues, but I, I believe Mr. Frankston said earlier, what we really need to get to and to your point earlier, if you go to war with the supply chain you have, we need to be more proactive and looking forward, right? Um, because we've already identified a number of strategic, um, problems in our supply chain where where we need to address those issues. These authorities have been very helpful to us in doing that. I think they're just part of the puzzle, to be honest with you, um, there are a number of other tools that that we have also from our, our science and technology portfolios to other investment opportunities, um, but I, I believe we need a whole of nation approach, honestly that looks at everything that we have, um, to be able to start to proactively prepare for a surge. What we saw during COVID, um, as, as the, the fund, um, jumped up significantly in importance and a number of projects, uh, number of dollars in invested, etc. um, we mobilized very quickly. It was an all hands on deck kind of effort, um, and we have a number of, of lessons learned in in how we've organized now that we've continued um to to try to be more effective and efficient uh in, in identifying issues and setting priorities, but I, I believe we have to keep that going into the future.

Speaker 1 [10:42:18 AM]
Yeah, thank you both. I, my time's expired and I now recognize the Chairman Hill for 5 minutes.

Speaker 2 [10:42:24 AM]
Mr. Davidson, thank you, and I, I do recognize that Ohio is the birthplace of aviation, but the actual aviation took place in North Carolina. Kitty Hawk, I think.

Speaker 3 [10:42:36 AM]
And, and the University of Michigan's they're nautical engineering program was started by people who were connected with the rights, so all, all the states here

Speaker 2 [10:42:44 AM]
where

Speaker 3 [10:42:44 AM]
all in good stead by being here at the birthplace of aviation. Mr. Frankston, um

Speaker 2 [10:42:51 AM]
current

Speaker 3 [10:42:51 AM]
industrial base, doesn't have surge capacity? Where are we the weakest in our defense industrial

Speaker 2 [10:42:57 AM]
base.

Speaker 3 [10:42:59 AM]
Going back to my earlier point that we have wars underway with supply chain constraints, and we have strategic supply chain string of supply constraints. So what down at the Pentagon, what's worries you the most about surge capacity

Speaker 4 [10:43:16 AM]
Um, thank you for the question, sir. Uh, I, I'm a naval historian and analyst by Education and trade, and I, navy capacity, shipbuilding and ship repair capacity. Uh, we made some very um interesting decisions is from the peace dividend in the at the end of the Cold War, and we have a much reduced capacity for ship repair and ship construction, uh, and this has been a priority of this administration through the maritime dominance EO and other critical areas that our office is supporting, uh, as Doctor Ormsby mentioned, there's been a number of investments in castings and forgings. We have a workforce training programs to expand, uh, because that is something I'll, I'll also emphasize for as much as we have the actual facilities and the equipment challenges, and we need to expand capacity. We need the people that need to be hired and retained in these industries and uh have good high paying quality, high skilled jobs and be there when we need to

Speaker 2 [10:44:15 AM]
search.

Speaker 3 [10:44:16 AM]
Proud to be on a very, very cold winter day at Newport News last year to see the USS Arkansas christened.

Speaker 5 [10:44:22 AM]
our

Speaker 3 [10:44:23 AM]
newest, uh, fast attack sub proud to have her name back on a ship in the fleet. Uh, Doctor Ornsby, uh, Title II grants, um, as someone responsible for executing that big picture strategy. Do you receive feedback from businesses about how well mass production is working under Title III, just a practical feedback question.

Speaker 2 [10:44:51 AM]
Uh,

Speaker 5 [10:44:51 AM]
yes, Chairman Hill, uh, thank you for the question. We, we do, um, what, what we really get, uh, from, from industry a lot uh because they do recognize that that we execute a lot of the projects, um, is those uh white papers and those recommendations of places where they see need for investment, uh, where they are having issues in their supply chains, um, and we facilitate them uh getting in touch with Mr. Frank s ton ' s office, um, to, to actually make proposals, um, either through the other transactions or through our uh open uh funding opportunity announcement.

Speaker 3 [10:45:32 AM]
That's good. Um, how does the research lab's man tech program sort of bridge the gap uh between early stage innovation and scalable industrial capacity. I see this as a constant complaint in Congress

Speaker 2 [10:45:47 AM]
is

Speaker 3 [10:45:48 AM]
breaking into the supply chain, which the president's taking action on, which I'm fully supportive of, but once in the supply chain, if you're in early stage development company, how you can scale up. Tell me about your bridging there.

Speaker 5 [10:46:03 AM]
Yes, sir. Um, thank you for that question. That, that's, uh, uh, a nice tie between our science and technology investments, which are different appropriation, um, that, that I also control, um, where, where we can um invest with our industrial-based partners to develop manufacturing processes, um, to either get uh faster production, lower cost, or to develop a domestic source for production if one doesn't exist. 4 things in my case that are important to the Department of the Air Force, Space and Air Force, um, there is a, a main tech program in every service, so that, you know, you can, can take the cookie cutter to the other services, um, once we can, can develop that initial manufacturing process, then frequently we see a need to now scale it, um, and that's where the the Title III authorities really come to play and, and help to uh now get you to the full scale that we need,

Speaker 3 [10:47:06 AM]
and you think those are working effectively? Is there one thing if you could change one thing, what would it

Speaker 5 [10:47:09 AM]
be? I believe those are working effectively, yes, um, I, I could give you a couple of uh uh anecdotal examples, uh, where I see them working if, if you would like. Um, but I don't want to take your time, OK? No, good.

Speaker 3 [10:47:21 AM]
Thank you. That'd be helpful. I yield back, Mr. Trim.

Speaker 1 [10:47:24 AM]
Oh, thank you, Mr. Hill. I now recognize the Vice Chairman, Mr. Hayya, for 5

Speaker 2 [10:47:28 AM]
minutes.

Speaker 6 [10:47:29 AM]
Thank you, Mr. Sherman. Um, so let's go back and unpack the uh the the six sort of funds that we have and, and uh we have Title III, which I think is self-explanatory. Uh, we then have what I would say maybe are conflict related supplementals, uh, in the Pacific, Israel, and Ukraine, and then we have, I'm not sure quite what category to put this in. CARES Act and the IRA, um, so, uh, uh, Doctor uh Ormsby had said there were some lessons learned from COVID. Uh, we can get into those, but I really want to know, uh you know, what, what do each one of those various uh buckets of funding, what do they cover? What are they being used

Speaker 4 [10:48:14 AM]
for? Thank you for the question. So we have uh a number of different, uh, similar but uh uh but uh different uh funding priorities within each of those uh uh buckets of, of money and

Speaker 2 [10:48:30 AM]
uh

Speaker 4 [10:48:31 AM]
the Ukraine and Israel supplementals, much of that went towards our missiles and and munitions productions where we found that when we tried to surge, some of the key weapon systems that were supporting and providing in support of those conflicts. The dollars went to those, whether through solid rocket motors or castings and forgings, um,

Speaker 6 [10:48:51 AM]
to expand capacity.

Speaker 4 [10:48:52 AM]
Yes, sir. OK. Um, but generally, uh, to expand capacity just when we knew that we weren't able to ramp as much as we needed to based on the numbers that we needed for our own needs and then what we were providing overseas.

Speaker 6 [10:49:04 AM]
How about Indo Pacific?

Speaker 4 [10:49:05 AM]
Uh, same thing, so it's some different munitions, different types, but generally the same areas we have shortfalls across munitions, which is where each of those funds were

Speaker 5 [10:49:14 AM]
targeting.

Speaker 6 [10:49:15 AM]
OK, how about uh CARES and IRA. What was that money used for?

Speaker 4 [10:49:19 AM]
Uh, CAR's and I, so this was before my time. I understand uh uh but a lot of it went towards

Speaker 6 [10:49:25 AM]
and not all of us up here supported necessarily all those expansions. So I'm just trying to figure out as, uh, you know, what the expiration dates might be on that. Is there a need to be continuing parts or or those uh those programs at all.

Speaker 4 [10:49:38 AM]
I'd be happy to get you some additional details for the record on the specifics on the timing for the rest of the money and the expirations and where, where it's going to, sir.

Speaker 6 [10:49:46 AM]
OK. Uh, do you have any examples of what CARES or IRA was used for.

Speaker 4 [10:49:50 AM]
Sure, so some of it went to ventilators, some of it went to, um, uh, needles, syringes, uh, protective equipments, uh, a lot of just me basically

Speaker 6 [10:49:59 AM]
where we were seeing a shortfall in supply

Speaker 4 [10:50:01 AM]
chain, sir.

Speaker 6 [10:50:02 AM]
OK. Uh, Title II, I think was a self-explanatory. Um, the, I, I want to touch on this remaining uh little couple of minutes here on chips in production. I obviously, as you were saying, uh, you know, the critical minerals and then the missiles and munitions were sort of the focus. You don't have missiles and munitions if you don't have chips. Uh, you don't have chips unless you have critical minerals. Uh, so, uh, explain to me what, uh, how that might factor into uh into what we're doing

Speaker 4 [10:50:36 AM]
here. Uh thank you for the question. Microelectronics and chips are essential to just about every weapon system that that we have in Macon. So there's been a number of investments within DPA, but then as Dr. Ormy was mentioning in some of the other funds that are out there and then some of the service investment themselves have made in this. There's been several programs that were being used to resource, um, both, uh, large scale chip production and then some of the more niche uh uh microchips for some of the more exquisite weapon systems and some of the more exquisite capabilities that we have. Uh, there's still a lot of work to go, uh, so that we can continue to

Speaker 6 [10:51:13 AM]
onshore because we're not there yet, right, and our production capability, I mean that that was part of the, these, these various uh previous buckets that we were talking about. We're talking about shortfall because we'd sent off a lot of our, uh our weapons systems, but then it also seems that we have, we have some gaps that need to get filled, correct? And, and is DPA trying to fill those specifically when it comes to chips, chips production, vis a vis what um what we see production here in the United States versus what what is produced overseas.

Speaker 4 [10:51:44 AM]
Yes sir, and it ranges across the supply chain too, just because whether it's the the actual foundry or the, the production of the wafer itself or the mineral, as you mentioned, that goes into it. We need to secure both the supply, not just of the raw material, but the processing, um, much of which went to China. over the last 30 years, and so it's a concerted effort to bring back not just the material, the mineral itself, but where that chip is being manufactured in all aspects of its supply chain.

Speaker 6 [10:52:13 AM]
And finally, you are part of any CIFfius review of that, correct?

Speaker 4 [10:52:17 AM]
I am not personally part of but

Speaker 6 [10:52:20 AM]
but Sifius is part of that review

Speaker 2 [10:52:21 AM]
OK,

Speaker 6 [10:52:22 AM]
and I'll maybe reserve my question about where we are currently on CIFIA's review at the age 20s and other chip capabilities and, and uh some recent announcements as to where those are being shipped, do have times expired, but we'll continue this later. Thank you. You'll bet. Thank you,

Speaker 1 [10:52:40 AM]
Mr. Moore from North Carolina is now recognized for 5 minutes.

Speaker 2 [10:52:43 AM]
Thank

Speaker 6 [10:52:43 AM]
you, Mr. Chairman. I, I wanted to follow

Speaker 1 [10:52:45 AM]
up with Mr. Frankson about the discussion about the shipbuilding. One of, uh,

Speaker 6 [10:52:49 AM]
one of our colleagues Representative Jen Kee gan from, uh, Virginia

Speaker 1 [10:52:53 AM]
was one of the members that frankly brought me up to speed on the fact of how far behind

Speaker 6 [10:52:58 AM]
we are, particularly China, in terms of the

Speaker 1 [10:53:00 AM]
production of ships, uh, between the two nations.

Speaker 6 [10:53:05 AM]
And what, what is the administration looking at to ramp that up? Like what is the, what is the short-term

Speaker 1 [10:53:10 AM]
plan and what is the long-term plan to, to facilitate that.

Speaker 4 [10:53:14 AM]
Uh, I, I appreciate the question on shipbuilding. This is a uh area of deep concern and passion to me. The maritime dominance, uh, EO. I don't recall the date that it came out. It was one of the longest ones ever written due to the, due to where we are on shipbuilding in the state of shipbuilding. Uh, so it's looking across the board at both, not just for defense requirements, then also on the commercial side, there is uh weekly meetings across each of the aspects of that, uh, executive order working for commercial shipbuilding, working for US military shipbuilding, the military sealift Command, the Maritime Administration through the Department of Transportation, all of that is is critical, because it's the same limited industrial base supporting each of those components, uh, so that when we work together to go target um a pump or a valve manufacturer. It doesn't matter if that's going to be at a company that's supporting a commerci al vendor right now that Dover or or pump that's so far down the supply chain could easily be turned to build capacity for US shipbuilding. So there is a number of different efforts both within our um presidential budget and what we build in a process looking to expand our shipbuilding capability and capacity because this administration recognizes that we have a particular challenge to match what China has ramped up their own capacity.

Speaker 6 [10:54:39 AM]
So in terms of what Congress do, obviously money in terms of appropriation, but are there other, in addition to that, are there regulatory matters or there are other things that Congress can do that could help facilitate this process.

Speaker 4 [10:54:52 AM]
I'd be happy to get back a formal response for the record on some of those recommendations, sir.

Speaker 2 [10:54:56 AM]
All right.

Speaker 6 [10:54:57 AM]
And then in terms of, uh, Mr. Hazinga asked you a question. I think similarly on the same lines, but, but the question had to do with the IRA and, and CARES. Have you been able to go through and look at some of the procurement and find some areas where funds can be repurposed, perhaps funds are going to areas that are not as um critical. Uh, where you're able to repurpose that some of the other areas that where we do see some shortfall, at least in an immediate um an immediate time frame.

Speaker 4 [10:55:25 AM]
Uh, we continue to look for opportunities on where our funding has been aligned, whether from a previous priority that may have changed based on a real world events. Uh, we are always looking at our portfolio to support, not just where um we see things but where our leadership is directing us, so we have some very strong internal guidance from our uh Department of Defense leadership on their key priorities, so critical minerals and missiles and munitions are two of the top, and so we are looking across our resourcing areas because again, you cannot build a a missile, a fighter plane, a jet, a tank, a ship. If you don't have the raw materials, the raw minerals, nor do if you have the weapons to actually use from that

Speaker 2 [10:56:06 AM]
platform, right? And Dr.

Speaker 1 [10:56:08 AM]
Orms, would you like to respond to that same question as well.

Speaker 5 [10:56:11 AM]
Yes sir, thank you. I appreciate the question. Um, I would simply add, um, not only reevaluating the priorities and continually looking at the portfolio, but then there are also times when for various reasons. Uh, we start down a path of making an award and uh in the end, the company doesn't agree to the terms. They changed their business strategy. Our priorities change, what have you, um, and then that gives us another opportunity as well to then redeploy those funds for a different priority.

Speaker 6 [10:56:45 AM]
What, what I would ask is that as you, as you supply further response as appropriate, provide advice for Congress in terms of ways to streamline the process or to improve efficiencies. One thing this Congress has worked very, very hard on as well as the administration is improving government efficiency, getting rid of waste, getting rid, just trying to cut through the bureaucracy if there are things that would require congressional action that would, that would I don't know, get rid of some of the shackles that are, that are slowing the ability to be more nimble and respond, particularly as other nations take very rapid actions. Uh, please let us know that because I, I, I'm certainly interested and I think probably most of my colleagues are as well. With that I yield back, Mr. Chairman.

Speaker 1 [10:57:30 AM]
Uh, I think our witnesses really appreciate your testimony today, and we'll pause for a bit as we switch to our second panel. Thank you very

Speaker 2 [10:57:38 AM]
much.

Speaker 5 [10:57:40 AM]
Thank you very

Speaker 4 [10:57:40 AM]
much. Thank

Speaker 2 [10:57:41 AM]
you.

Speaker 1 [11:04:34 AM]
Institutions will come to order. I'd like to thank our, uh, thanks again to our first panel of witnesses. And so now I'd like to welcome our second panel of witnesses, um, first, Mr. Robert Faxon is the chairman of the board at Consolidated Boring Inc. and Mr. Gordon Fallon is the chief product officer at Beehive Industries. Uh, we thank you both for taking time to be here, and you'll each be recognized for 5 minutes to give an oral presentation of your testimony. Without objection, your written statements will be made part of the record. Mr. Faxon, you're now recognized for 5 minutes for your oral

Speaker 2 [11:05:08 AM]
statement

Speaker 6 [11:05:10 AM]
Thank you, Chairman Hill, Chairman Davidson, and members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. My name is Robert Faxon, chairman of the board for Consolidated Boing Incorporated, a company formed in 2021 in the acquisition of fax and Machining in Cincinnati,

Speaker 7 [11:05:23 AM]
Ohio, and a division of ATI now called American Flow For Machining and Bill Rickham, Massachusetts. These two companies represent almost 100 years of combined manufacturing. My testimony represents the most accurate and truthful representation of the current situation that I can offer based on my personal interactions with both government and industry, and it's totally of my own opinion and may or may not represent the balance of the CBI team. I bring over 47 years of hands-on manufacturing experience, including over 25 years specifically in the defense industry. Staring at the age of 13, working part-time in family business in Cincinnati. Facts and machining located in Cincinnati, Ohio operates 185,000 square foot facility manufacturing warheads and precision components for critical defense programs such as the GBU 57 Massive Ordinance penetrator, which we produced 7 of the 14 30,000 pound bunker buster bombs used in the Iranian nuclear facility strike. Blue 137, 20 00 pound bunker busters. The GMLS unitary warhead. Facts and machining played a key role in the Blue 136 next generation air attack weapon program from concept and development all the way through full rate production as a prime contractor for the US Air Force. Companies also advancing modernization efforts and artillery production with plans for state of the art facility capable of vertically integrated manufacturing, producing up to 450,000 modular artillery shells annually to support evolving military requirements. Facts and machine sports major defense contracts, including General Dynamics, ARA, Lockheed Martin Northrop Grumman, US government, and many others. American Flow form Machining based in Boreham, Massachusetts operates a 65,000 ft facility focused on manufacture of large diameter steel rocket motor cases. Many smaller rocket motor

Speaker 2 [11:06:57 AM]
cases.

Speaker 6 [11:06:58 AM]
Over 1 million Roer

Speaker 7 [11:06:59 AM]
meter cases have been produced in this facility since its inception. AFM supplies parts for missile systems including Stage 1 MK 72 rocket motor case for the SM3 and SM 6 missiles. Stinger, tow rocket motors, and his launching production of Rock and utter cases for a system like the ground launch SDB1 for Andre. FM also has been contacted to produce MK 104 and GEMT Patriot Rockemuter cases. Additionally, FM's sports programs such as Zuni, MK-22 mine clearing systems just to name a few. We're actively engaged in innovative companies to support projects like Golden Dome and Iron Dome. National Security and Defense Industrial-based challenges. The demand for large steel rocket motors, especially those 13 inches and larger in diameter, growing rapidly due to today's evolving geopolitical environment. For example, the combined demand for the MK 72 MK 104, and GEMT Patriot cases is approximately 3000 units annually, far exceeding current AFM capacity of 350 to 400 large rocketter cases. AFM is uniquely positioned to address the shortage with proposed vertically integrated rocket motor case factory capable of producing 3000 cases per year. The filial strength and supply chain resilience by internalizing all manufacturing processes and steps, reducing dependence on external suppliers and support surge capacity during times of crisis. A new factory would create roughly 300 skilled manufacturing jobs in Massachusetts. It generates significant cost savings for the government. Additionally, this factory would play a key role in supporting current and future defense programs, including the administration's proposed Golden Dome initiative. Experience with Title II funding and recommendations. AFM has worked closely with the Defense Production Act Title II Office during its efforts to secure funding for this factory expansion and has subm it ted a Title II funding request for a new facility while the potential impact is significant. Process from application to award is proven lengthy and complex, which can be discouraging for smaller companies to pursue these opportunities. This delay risked leaving critical defense manufacturing capacity unmet amid urgent national security needs. To address this, I recommend multi-year predictable funding and streamlined application process to reduce uncertainty and incentivize timely project starts. If industry is being asked to move at the speed of war, then our partners being US government, will also have to move at the speed of war. While the primary focus of this funding is the Defense Industrial base. It's equally important to support and strengthen the broader industrial base, including commercial and non-DOD manufacturers. So these companies remain financially viable in the marketplace and can rapidly pivot to defense production if needed. This approach not only enhances national security but also promotes reshoring sports high-skilled jobs and ensures more resilient, competitive manufacturing ecosystem overall. Conclusion, the investment reforms I've described are vital to securing our nation's defense industrial-based manufacturing future. With the right support, consolidated Boing Work incorporated through its operating company's fax and Machine EFM stands ready to deliver the critical capabilities our military requires and respectfully requests that the Title III submission already accepted but not yet funded, be funded not only for the original mount but also for the additional amount necessary to meet current demands. It's not only important for our company, but the entire defense industrial base. These efforts can take years to complete under normal circumstances. Several of the key pieces of equipment there served for the rocket motor factory will need to be manufactured from the ground up. Designed, built, tested, runoff and installed, in some cases will take well over 2 years to complete before additional production can begin. If anything were to occur that impedes a normal operating environment, these timelines could stretch even further, potentially delaying completion by several years. The stakes are too high to risk such delays. Failure to act now could leave the United States without sufficient rocket motor production capacity to sustain a prolonged or high intensity conflict, placing both our national security and our warfighters and unacceptable risk. Act now and be responsible. We must act now to be responsible. Stuarts in meeting the known and immediate needs, our military leaders have clearly challenged us with in order to properly support our war fighters and our allies. Thank you for your time. I look forward to your questions.

Speaker 1 [11:10:39 AM]
Thank you, Mr. Faxon. Mr. Mr. Fallon, you're now recognized for 5 minutes for your oral

Speaker 2 [11:10:45 AM]
remarks.

Speaker 6 [11:10:46 AM]
All right, thank you, uh, Chairman Davidson, Chairman Hill, and distinguished members of the committee, including Representatives Hanga and Moore. Uh, I appreciate the

Speaker 5 [11:10:53 AM]
opportunity to speak with you today on

Speaker 3 [11:10:54 AM]
the critical role

Speaker 6 [11:10:56 AM]
that the Defense Production Act has in strengthening our nation's defense. I'm Gordie Faul, and I'm the chief product officer of Beehive Industries, uh, at Beehive, uh, we're a US-based manufacturing company with over 300 employees at locations in Denver, Knoxville, and also in Cincinnati. In fact, we just opened an expanded facility down in Loveland, about 30 miles south of here. uh last week, so it's great to be with you today. Um, we specialize in additive manufacturing of jet engines for uncrewed weapons systems, counterUAS platforms and drones. Uh, Beehive's mission is powering American defense, and we're all in on helping the US and allied weapons US and allied nations replenish their weapons stockpiles which have been depleted over the last decades by global conflicts. Um, let me provide just a little example to put this challenge in context. Um, every month, Russia bombards Ukraine with over 700 drones launched in swarms of hundreds at a time,

Speaker 7 [11:11:51 AM]
wreaking havoc across the country.

Speaker 6 [11:11:53 AM]
The Ukraine, to defend itself, relies on advanced missile defense systems like the Iron Dome and the Patriot systems provided by the US and its allies. These systems work great, but there's two big problems. Uh, first of all, the Russian drones come from Iran. They cost about $50,000 apiece, and they can make 6000 plus a year. The projectiles used in the Ukraine systems to shoot them down cost between 1 and $4 million apiece. And right now we can only make about 2000 a year. So problem one is, uh, it currently costs the Ukraine about 50 times more to defend itself than it costs Russia to attack it. That's the opposite of deterrence. Problem number 2 is even if Ukraine could afford it, Russia's able to send 3 times more things at it than they can shoot down. right? So they are definitely disadvantaged in this conflict. And this is just one example, uh, future examples could include in the not so distant future, a US conflict with China which would face a similar challenge. Um, and traditional manufacturing processes can't solve these problems. The Department of Defense estimates that to rebuild stockpiles with existing systems would take more than 13 years and $430 billion which is time and money, we just don't have But additive manufacturing, uh, can help solve that challenge. By designing engines in a new way to fully leverage the potential of additive. We see engines that are 25% more efficient, less than half the cost. They can be developed, tested, and fielded in one quarter of the time. They can be scaled up to produce more than 10,000 engines a year and less than 3 years, at less than 20% of the cost of scaling conventional supply chains, and by printing jet engines domestically from raw powder, we eliminate the risk of foreign source comp on ent s disrupting supply of these critical

Speaker 2 [11:13:39 AM]
systems.

Speaker 6 [11:13:40 AM]
The Defense Protection Act and especially Title III, is essential in making this possible. Without it, scaling complex capital intensive manufacturing processes like ours is extremely risky. Uh, Beehive has benefited or will benefit in 4 ways from DPA Title II. First of all, it allows us to respond rapidly to new threats The traditional acquisition process can take 3+ years to go from a good idea that we know we need to do to actually starting with DPA you can start in less than a year, so it's a great tool for that. Um, it also provides preemptive investment, which allows us to invest in developing new products and scaling production capacity ahead of demand. Like you said, if you, when you go to war, you go to war with the supply chain you have, not the supply chain you want. It gives you a way to build that supply chain in advance. It also creates capital security for companies like ours that are privately funded, um, by extending our financial runway and also it signals DOD commitment, which encourages future private investment. That's really key for companies like ours. It also secures access to critical materials like high temperature metals which beehive relies on to make its products. To maximize the benefit and uh effectiveness of Title III, uh, Beehive, we have 4 recommendations for the committee. Um, one, preserve and clarify Title III authority to support innovation that delivers capability at scale, also called prototyped production transitions. This is how we get capabilities to the field faster with lower costs and risk. Our second recommendation is tailored Title III programs for agile, advanced manufacturers. Make it more accessible to non-traditional defense companies by streamlining contracts through OTAs, adjusting cost share requirements, uh, things like that. Recommendation 3 is continue to strengthen domestic supply chains for high temperature alloys, nickel super alloys, and titanium. I think we've talked about that quite a bit today. Uh, good progress just needs to continue. Uh those inputs are vulnerable to geopolitical risk, yet essential to products like propulsion. And the final recommendation, align Title III efforts with Allied industrial-based initiatives, especially NATO in ACIS. One great thing about additive manufacturing is it allows flexible distributed manufacturing, but it can only happen if there's standardization and coordination across nations. So in summary, the Defense Protection Act is the government's most important tool for rapidly responding to defense needs in times of crisis to protect our country and secure our future. Beehive urges the committee to act decisively in reauthorizing and modernizing this essential law.

Speaker 2 [11:16:09 AM]
Beehive

Speaker 6 [11:16:09 AM]
Industries stands ready to partner with the Department of Defense, our allies in this committee to confront these new challenges and ensure our warfighters have the tools and technologies they need when they need them. Thank you, and I welcome your questions.

Speaker 1 [11:16:21 AM]
Uh, thank you both. So we'll now turn to member questions. I recognize myself for 5 minutes. Uh, you both highlighted the need to surge and surge capacity and, you know, Mr. Faxon, you, you've certainly been part of that supply chain over the last few years as we've surged things to various areas Ukraine in particular with munitions, um, I wonder if you could highlight how you could use capabilities that are in DPA, um, to possibly refine and provide a bridge for capabilities with the the existing kind of status quo, um, acquisition programs. So if you look at uh arsenals or other programs, how do you use the private sector to provide surge capacity and how can DPA help us do that?

Speaker 7 [11:17:07 AM]
That's a good question. Thank you. Um, one of the concepts that we had is really if you look at the defense industrial base, it was undermined by the commercial industrial base. All of our factories have made sewing machines, made 45s in World War II. So there was a conversion of the commercial industrial base to the defense industrial base. Now we're focused very intensely on the industrial base, which is fine. I understand this

Speaker 2 [11:17:27 AM]
committee.

Speaker 7 [11:17:28 AM]
But if we were to invest in a facility to increase domes defense industrial base. If we added funding to increase commercial.

Speaker 2 [11:17:36 AM]
in

Speaker 7 [11:17:36 AM]
a modern technology-driven, cost-effective factor in the future, that commercial aspect not only offsets financial requirements for that and that facility to maintain its solvency, but it also can be converted back to defense if necessary, and if the defense gets good and everything gets better, then you take the defense and you convert it back over into the commercial industry. This supports our reshoring efforts that the terrorists and the current administration is pushing. It develops a commercial industrial base, so this is the seed for private investment to grow that commercial sector. I think focusing strictly on defense has limitations, and I think that the financial obligations later is going to be the word sustainment. They're going to have their hand out for sustaining in these facilities. If we build a factory such as the artillery factory that we proposed, it would serve as a model to any other component. It could be aircraft, it could be automotive. It could go in a washing machine. But the automation necessary takes funding to develop. It's a bleeding edge. Following it will be a leading edge. So DPA funding to support a known requirement such as modular artillery components, uh, not your standard 795 DForge, but your modular artillery rounds that manufacturing technology, we would open our doors and have competitors in other industries come in and view it and duplicate that mentality and put that into other commercial applications. That's how DPA funding could set a tone for a commercial base.

Speaker 1 [11:18:55 AM]
Yeah, thank you for highlighting that, and you look at the capability, flexible factories and the adaptive nature of some of the technology you guys are employing on your factory floors uh, really is the tip of the iceberg in terms of what's possible. And if we can incorporate that with the with our approach here, I really think we can respond to the to the times we're in. Mr. Fallon, you, you highlighted, you know how Title II helps you turn around a project faster instead of 3 years, you can do it in the first year. How does that cost sharing approach, not just attract companies like Beehive or other, um, private sector operators but also the suppliers of capital, whether that's banks or venture or other um sources of capital to have the confidence that this has got scalability.

Speaker 6 [11:19:42 AM]
Yes, so banks, I mean, banks and other investors, they're trying to evaluate companies for risk in order to make investments, and the cost of that investment depends on the perceived risk of the company. So I would say when there is when there's government investment in projects, it has a double benefit. One is it, it reduces the amount of capital you need to go raise. And second of all, it shows alignment with government priorities and pull from the government for the products that you're manufacturing and so it reduces the perceived risk of the company. And so therefore you're able to, to raise capital more quickly at a lower interest rate and uh and, and have better runway for the company in the future.

Speaker 1 [11:20:17 AM]
Yeah, so it's one thing though to send a demand signal. I mean, clearly the government wants these things, so why isn't demand enough? Why does the, why do taxpayers need to provide seed capital to certain sectors, and how do you, how do you strike the balance between that and just turn it into a planned economy where you've got some central planner picking winners and losers. How do you, how do you get that right?

Speaker 6 [11:20:38 AM]
Yeah, I think the Defense industrial base has been through cycles, and you know, we hear about, you know, forecasted ramps and production demand, but these are very, very expensive systems to ramp up for, right? You're talking tens or hundreds of millions of dollars of investment. So private industry will naturally want to wait until the signal is here to start investing because essentially they're borrowing that money until the demand arrives and sometimes it, it doesn't arrive. So I think, um, you know, basically this allows us to go out and secure, make those investments, secure that, and not have to carry the risk of those invest ment s actually getting put into full production at the at the timing expected.

Speaker 1 [11:21:18 AM]
We we'll have a second panel, but, um, I'll yield my time and recognize the chairman of the full committee, uh, Mr. Hill.

Speaker 3 [11:21:26 AM]
Uh thank, thanks, Chairman Davidson. Um Mr. Fax just continuing that same theme. You've made some comments in your prepared statement about

Speaker 2 [11:21:35 AM]
a

Speaker 3 [11:21:35 AM]
multi-year and sustained funding. Those were comments that you made, and then the speed of war Mr. Moore and I were at a meeting earlier this week out

Speaker 2 [11:21:43 AM]
in

Speaker 3 [11:21:44 AM]
in Wyoming where um that topic came up with some silicon, Silicon Valley presenters that they were very impressed with the Trump administration's approach to this issue, which

Speaker 2 [11:21:55 AM]
is

Speaker 3 [11:21:57 AM]
you know, we're going to start working, we're not going to talk about it. We're going to take action and being a much more action-oriented administration, but you got to balance that with the comments, Mr. Davis just made about. uh, things that we need in the supply chain ramp up. uh, so that it's

Speaker 6 [11:22:14 AM]
not

Speaker 3 [11:22:15 AM]
government directing things, you know, uh,

Speaker 2 [11:22:18 AM]
that

Speaker 3 [11:22:19 AM]
maybe don't have long-term viability. So how do you balance all that? I just want to let you continue your conversation you were having

Speaker 2 [11:22:25 AM]
with

Speaker 3 [11:22:26 AM]
Mr. Davis, you got 47 years of, uh, manufacturing experience. So what does DPA need to have changed in either the statute or its policy to. balance

Speaker 6 [11:22:38 AM]
that I think

Speaker 7 [11:22:40 AM]
components of that, thank you for the question. The components of that are actually built by several of the questions already came up. What is the requirement of uh private investment versus DPA funding? How, how do those go together? What is the longevity? What is the risk? And, and quite honestly, if you look at a normal business growth, if you're double digit on a kicker, you're doing really well at 10%. We're asked to quadruple in a year. So these ramp up cycles aren't conducive to your typical business growth. As a matter of fact, if you tried to do that in a normal manufacturing business, and I'm not talking about a high tech or something like that, but in hardcore manufacturing, high capital businesses, if you go to the bank and say, I'm gonna quadruple in a year. I think they'd rip up your application and throw you out. So these ramp up rates are a key component. The industrial base of it, when we look at what the longevity is, how long will you commit to how many rockets you want to buy. We don't really have that and we don't make this back in a year or two. In fact, iron investment in the factory because of vertical integration and cost savings offers approximately a 10% per unit cost reduction. So if you really looked at a business cycle of ROI for what we're asking for the government at that pace would be paid back in 10 years on cost reductions of purchase products. So financial feasibility is not just welfare. Give me money and I'm leaving. It's, I'm going to give back to you now if the government doesn't require that quantity over that period of time, you don't get your return on investment. That's true, but you're the one asking for it. I don't go broke because the bank wants me to answer for it when I'm not really the one who's demanding the product. So that circle of debt, longevity, and flexibility with the commercial viability. I, I can't emphasize that enough. Leading edge technology, whether it's software, hardware, physical presses, or technology is in most cases transferable. And when we're gonna reshore things, we're not going to do it at twice the cost. We're going to have to be competitive to make that successful, no matter what anybody says. they say buy American, but there's a price tag associated. We have to be more competitive. We can take these specific demands, put them in a true ROI, and if it does or doesn't pan out, we still led engineering and manufacturing to a higher level and a higher capability level.

Speaker 3 [11:24:43 AM]
Could I get you to break that down and use a practical example.

Speaker 2 [11:24:47 AM]
you

Speaker 3 [11:24:47 AM]
cited in your testimony, for example, that normal production of motor cases was 350 to 400 or something like that, but the demand was 3000. Yes, so talk practicality here to get up to a 3000 motor case run rate, what kind of investment had to be made in over how many months did it take to achieve that, just to use that practical example you referenced in your testimony. High

Speaker 7 [11:25:10 AM]
level our original was around the $80 million investment for 1300, which is roughly 110 per month. When you look at the scalability for that, you want to start with a green field for the efficiency and the long-term return. You don't want to put a band-aid on something you currently have. You, you go ground up. So the facilitization in the first year is pretty much non-return on quantity. There's minor input improvements. In year 1 to 2, certain pieces of equipment can be acquired. Take our original capacity and supplement that within year 1 to 2. That helps significantly. In year 2, most equipment is on the floor and gets evaluated and runoff in year 2 to 3. So you have a small incremental step in your 1 to 2, year 0 to 1 is not really a high return. Y 3 is where you really see your highest return, and that's where you consolidate all the equipment. These, these machines, some, in some cases will take weeks and months to move and years to get. So what you don't want to do is incrementally fund 4 small steps and not get to where you want to be. What we're offering and what I think needs to happen with companies like ours, because I'm familiar with them, great company. We're offering a national asset. We're offering something for the next 30 years, not 4. This is not a 5-year investment. This is setting a tone and a departure from typical manufacturing. We, we're not going to win if we keep doing what we've done. If we buy what we've had 10 years ago and it lasts 20 more, this world doesn't stay still for 30

Speaker 3 [11:26:28 AM]
years. Thank you. We'll continue this discussion. I yield back.

Speaker 1 [11:26:31 AM]
Thank you, Chairman. I now recognize the Vice Chairman of the full committee, Mr. Hayinga, for 5 minutes.

Speaker 6 [11:26:35 AM]
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You're going to hear a central theme on this. I leaned over to Chairman Davidson when he finished and, and I said that's virtually exactly what I had written down as my question. I was just going to use slightly less pejorative language, uh, when, when it comes to central planning, but I think that's a lot of the question concern, feedback that uh that I think not just from colleagues but from taxpayers that we hear, which is why are we making these investments into an industry that isn't needed. Well, you can't predict war, right? Uh,

Speaker 2 [11:27:15 AM]
uh, well

Speaker 6 [11:27:15 AM]
he can't predict mass war or something a conflict like what was happening in Russia and Ukraine, and I, I wanna, I, I, I want, uh, you know, Mr. Fraxson, you did a phenomenal job explaining it from, from your perspective on what was what was sort of the ramp up and the need, Mr. Fallon, I'd like you to maybe expand on that or or give us your take as well. I mean, you talked about perceived risk, uh, that really this is sort of in a way the government funding might be that bell cow, as some might say, right, it's others are going to follow that. They're going to, uh, they're going to view that as as a lead. Oftentimes though, when we are doing our appropriations, we want to see um you know, end of fiscal year production. We have a much different timeline than than you might have, and I'm really curious, do you believe that the programs that we have, uh, one, allow you to build the capacity for not just an immediate but for long term, how do we maintain that 2, do you have the flexibility to innovate and explore within those programs and, you know, one of the sort of the central themes of of a truly free market is, you know, the uh the the ability to fail and learn from that failure. Um, we don't like that when we're sending taxpayer dollars. We don't want to see failures, but are there enough places where you can take lessons learned and apply it so that we do have a stabilized uh production

Speaker 2 [11:28:47 AM]
base.

Speaker 6 [11:28:50 AM]
Yeah, I think for that question, it's a great question. Um, I'll start with the last piece first, uh, in terms of the ability to fail, I think when you use uh DPA Title $3 to support development, then it allows the government to partner with industry as they're developing the product as we're understanding what are the risks and challenges that it takes to bring that product into full production, um, and then we can, we can kind of navigate that together as we learn and, and come up with, you know, solutions to solve problems that invariably come up through the through the development phase. So I think uh DPA allows us to partner in that phase versus if we were doing it on our own dollars, we'd be trying to figure it out on our own and and sometimes the government can have solutions or resources they can bring to bear to also help in those situations. Yeah, let me interrupt you super quick on that. I mean, this is called the Defense Production Act. Uh, so I think that makes a lot of sense to people when it's defense related. Are we focused enough with the DPA right now? Is it really into that defense mode, or have we wandered away from that? uh from that core objective. Yeah, so my personal experience is primarily with DPA for defense, so I can't comment necessarily on the percentage of funding that they make outside of defense. I would say that my experience so far is that it is focused on the priorities of the administration of the DOD, uh, so in our case, like we're working on these critical munitions that I think we've heard talked about as a priority from, from uh the other folks in their earlier testimony. Um, so I feel like it is focused in areas that are important I think it could it be improved? I'm sure it could. Um, what I would say is, uh, in terms of, you know, does the funding support ramping up to actually support the rates. Um, what happens if, if volume changes, how fast can you change? Um, I would say one of the advantages of, of additive is it can ramp up very quickly. It doesn't require like big megafoundries in order to scale it up. You're basically buying things that look like, uh, inkjet printers, right? They're bigger, they're more industrial, but uh they look kind of like that. Um, in terms of timing, in 15 months, so in 15 months we can double production. So right now we have the ability to make about 2000 engines a year and 15 months, we'll ramp that up to be close to 5000 and then another 15 months after that, we could be ready to support uh close to 10,000, which is what we've been given by the DOD as a target. So again, you compare that to 100 years of manufacturing things conventionally, and we can make $2000 a year, right? So it's, it's really promising, I think what it can, what it can offer. The other advantage of additive is it's easy to distribute. Um, what that means is once you have a design and once you've kind of validated how to manufacture it. There's 3D printers all over the world. right? So in a time where there's, uh, you need a surge, we can take the design, we can export it to a DOD facility or another industrial facility, and they could make the design from, from our design just by putting it in their printer. It's a pretty automated process. You don't need a lot of specialized labor to do that. Um, so it's, it's pretty easily scalable. And the other big advantage is, um, you know, a lot of conventional manufacturing requires very bespoke, expensive, long lead tooling right, in order to make a part. The 3D printer doesn't care what it's printing. It can print key chains one day and print jet engines the next day. It doesn't care, right? It doesn't have a memory. It's not targeted for anything specifically. The other advantage of that is as priorities for the DOD change, we can change what that capacity is being used for, right? So beehive has picked this mission because this is a big priority for the DOD and we think it's, it's probably the area where added manufacturing is most fertile, but as priorities change, the, the capacity could change with the priorities to support what's what's being needed.

Speaker 2 [11:32:30 AM]
Thank you.

Speaker 1 [11:32:33 AM]
Yeah. Thank you. um I'd like to recognize Mr. Moore from North Carolina for 5 minutes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. One of the things that, that I've heard from folks is that they feel like the way the

Speaker 6 [11:32:44 AM]
procurement process is set up and you get and you alluded to this your comments, really is geared toward large

Speaker 1 [11:32:50 AM]
companies as opposed to small and medium-sized businesses. And if I think

Speaker 2 [11:32:55 AM]
about probably

Speaker 1 [11:32:57 AM]
no better example than really here in Dayton when I think of a small business, I mean, two guys in a bicycle shop are what led to the birth of aviation. I mean, and that's

Speaker 6 [11:33:07 AM]
the story of American ingenuity, um, and, and if you look at how small and medium sized businesses can be more nimble and agile and,

Speaker 2 [11:33:16 AM]
and

Speaker 6 [11:33:17 AM]
dealing with market change and other things. Obviously capitalization and financing the

Speaker 1 [11:33:21 AM]
challenge of Mr. Faction. You, you, you mentioned earlier. I just wonder, any suggestions as guys who were in the trenches.

Speaker 6 [11:33:29 AM]
of ways that, that the process can be improved in terms of the procurement and ways to really take advantage of this amazing, uniquely American thing that we have in

Speaker 1 [11:33:42 AM]
terms of the small and medium-sized businesses. I think, frankly, that's one of the advantages we have over China and other places.

Speaker 6 [11:33:48 AM]
Uh, any, any suggestions on how we change that to,

Speaker 1 [11:33:51 AM]
to fully utilize them.

Speaker 2 [11:33:55 AM]
And you both are

Speaker 6 [11:33:55 AM]
welcome to respond. So yeah, thank you for that. Um, I, I think a couple of things I referred to this in my testimony as well. I, I think the first is, um, you know, uh, 515 contracts can be very complex, lots of flow down requirements. It requires, uh, in some places a lot of systems be put in place before you can start, uh, it can really slow down the process. I think using OTAs wherever possible, is much more small business friendly. I think in our experience so far, that's been the case, but it's not always the case. So I'd say continue to do that. Uh, the other big one is, um, if there's a way to reduce cost share, I think it absolutely makes sense. You want companies to have skin in the game as well, right? We don't want them just to be gambling with government dollars, but right now I think on average Beehive's cost share on its programs is between 50% and 80%, right? And so again these are still large investments. I mean, beehives invested over $300 million to date. There's not a lot of companies that can do that, not a lot of small businesses that can raise $300 million to put ourselves in the position we're in. So I, I think from my perspective, those are the two big ones. Also, I think for a new small business, the process is pretty complex and so maybe um a little more support navigating the process early on would be good as well, just to make sure that, that, uh, you know, the, the flowdown of the requirements, the expectations are clear. This would be my suggestions.

Speaker 2 [11:35:14 AM]
OK, thank you.

Speaker 6 [11:35:15 AM]
Thanks. I think

Speaker 7 [11:35:17 AM]
from a from a bureaucratic standpoint, I, I wouldn't have any really strong input. What I would think is there are a lot of people out there that if, if the DPA committee did a search for key capabilities and targeted the mid to small sized businesses, get out and go see them. Take people with enough authority and understanding to make an evaluation on the spot. Give him a checkbook. Give him authority, get in front of the people, have a discussion, evaluate him quickly face to face, size up the company, see what they can do, ask them, bring them into the fold, go see them. I think that would be my encouragement to it. It's it's not a meeting that we all leave here and go to our different worlds. Go see them, solicit them, bring them in, show them the path to be able to do what they want. There's many Americans out there today that are highly talented who work 12 to 15 hour days if given the chance and avenue. I think, I think going out to see them eye to eye that would be my

Speaker 2 [11:36:12 AM]
suggestion

Speaker 6 [11:36:13 AM]
And then, and then in terms

Speaker 1 [11:36:14 AM]
of doing that, so a small company develops, for example, the prototype. Ms. Fong, you mentioned about like, you know, the, the 3D printing that can be done, but it

Speaker 6 [11:36:21 AM]
sounds like maybe the capitalization to take that prototype which is needed in

Speaker 1 [11:36:26 AM]
the full ramp production. All right, what do you see in this working along those lines right now and where do you see where there's still the shortcomings, specifically at that at that level.

Speaker 6 [11:36:35 AM]
Yeah, I think in in our specific case, I think uh DPA and OSD were very creative in finding a way to support what we're trying to do. So typically, uh, Title $3 are really for capacity expansion, so it's infrastructure you're buying in our case, you'd buy printers, you'd buy CNC machines or whatever. One of the things that I thought was a really great um innovation was looking at, hey, current suppliers can't meet capacity. So part of expanding capacity is we have to develop a new option right? So it included dollars for actual R&D so we can develop an option that then we can scale. So in our case, about 70% of the funds were for actually working on the innovation and getting it ready to take to production. The other 30% was for capacity. right? So I think that's, that's a nice change from the status quo and something that should continue, I think. Thank you.

Speaker 2 [11:37:26 AM]
uh,

Speaker 1 [11:37:28 AM]
anything on Thank you, Mr. Moore. Look, um, Mr. Faxson, when you were speaking earlier, uh, I recalled a conversation with my banker at one point who said, Did you ever think about growing more slowly and maybe playing more golf or whatever I was growing a little too fast for the taste of the bankers and frankly for the taste of the bank regulators who wanted to start treating my line of credit as if I was using 100% of it. And when I think, Mr. Fallon, you highlight the amount of capital raised you've been able to do, it's a lot easier to raise capital for something new and sexy. that could turn into a giant market someday then for old technology, and you know, as promising as additive manufacturing is and capability, it still can't do everything that you can do with a cast park and certainly getting the hardness and capability out of forgings, that's old, not so sexy tech. How do you raise the capital for things like that and how important is it that uh DPA or other means do it because the private sector market has plenty of demand for castings, forgings, injection molded parts, or metal stamped parts. But if we lose that capability, which largely at scale we have already, uh, we don't have surge capacity in our country, so maybe if you guys could highlight and touch on

Speaker 2 [11:38:38 AM]
that.

Speaker 6 [11:38:40 AM]
Sure, I mean, um, you know, in a, in a missile, uh, only a small part of it is printable, right? So I think to the point made earlier, if you're missing one part from a system, then you don't have the system, right? So I think it's not a one size fits all approach. I think you have to look at kind of holistically across the whole system where the bottlenecks and how can you address those bottlenecks. So I, I, you know, our, our view is like additive manufacturing does play a key role, but it's not the only one. And there are other areas that are going to need support as well, so businesses like Mr. Faxon's, right, they make a part of the, the weapon as well, and it's not additively manufactured for the most part. It's got conventional manufacturing, but those things also have to be ramped up in order to support the ultimate final demand.

Speaker 2 [11:39:25 AM]
Thank you.

Speaker 7 [11:39:26 AM]
I think something I would add is when we talk about the defense industrial base, there's really a broad variety of technologies. I'm incredibly impressed with the capability of additive. We're not going to make a 30,000 pound bunker buster bomb through additive. That's that's not on next week's agenda, but what is important is to say what companies can fit what roles. There are companies like Boeing and Northrop. If you want a fighter plane, don't talk to me. But if you talk about subcomponent and component levels in its block and tackle needs to be done. Takes a lot of hours, equipment. It's just, it's just work. Then you can go to these other places, and I think if you really want to increase the capacity, you've got to define where the requirements of the work scope is. We, we don't make satellites. We don't communicate with laser beams, but what we do is we make metal parts. If you can allocate some of that capacity to this mid-level small business, they'll bleed for you. They'll be dying to get that business. Now that leaves capacity and other things for the more technical things that the larger

Speaker 2 [11:40:21 AM]
companies

Speaker 6 [11:40:23 AM]
really are good at.

Speaker 7 [11:40:24 AM]
So I, I think that's important to differentiate what the work scope is. It's not all the same.

Speaker 1 [11:40:28 AM]
Thank you both. I recognize Chairman Hill.

Speaker 3 [11:40:32 AM]
Thank you, Chairman. Uh, I wanted to follow up, uh, Mr. Folen on some of your testimony, you made reference to accelerating contracting tools. Could you elaborate on that

Speaker 6 [11:40:44 AM]
Yeah, I think, um, the, the primary comment is, uh, you know, OTA contracts, other transactional authorities, give more flexibility in terms of terms and conditions and uh also

Speaker 3 [11:40:54 AM]
like, can you give us an example? Just compare one this, you know, non using that to using it.

Speaker 6 [11:41:00 AM]
Yeah, so for example, if I mean there there's two primary ways to do contracting, one for defense, one would be like through a far 15 contract which requires uh much more detail in how you plan to allocate costs, much more detail on how you roll up costs. You have to have uh cost accounting audits performed on various components. Um, for small business, especially a, a small business that isn't in production yet, being able to provide like validated costs for something that's not invented yet becomes extremely difficult, right? And so, uh, OTAs allow you to use like engineering estimates, best judgment. Uh, you still have to substantiate it. I mean, it's still competitively bid, so, you know, nobody's taking advantage of the government, but it gives more flexibility when you don't have that background or you're making something that hasn't been made before.

Speaker 3 [11:41:45 AM]
Another piece of your testimony I thought was, uh, interesting. I, I do think we have to have critical elements made here, whether it's um particularly in the defense arena. but I've also been someone who, you know, if it's made in other places that are allies of the United States. I think that's good. It might be at risk, for example, no one questions the extraordinary manufacturing capability and invention, hard work, dynamism in South Korea or Japan, but as a supply chain, if we were in a Pacific conflict, uh, that would be uh not the ideal location.

Speaker 2 [11:42:22 AM]
So

Speaker 3 [11:42:23 AM]
this idea of friend shoring I think is important uh to collaborate and spread that out, benefits the entire allied nation in case of a global conflict, whether it's in Europe or Canada or the US

Speaker 2 [11:42:35 AM]
or

Speaker 3 [11:42:36 AM]
in Asia. So tell me a little bit about alignment. You make your point about the Allied industrial base. So the work your two companies are doing and the designs you take,

Speaker 2 [11:42:48 AM]
those would be

Speaker 3 [11:42:49 AM]
as you say, duplicable uh in your particular case at Beehive, uh, in those other industrial bases. Is that right? And what do we need to be doing differently in DPA to reflect

Speaker 6 [11:43:01 AM]
that? Yeah, I think what I'm referring to in my testimony is really around like having like common standards, um, so that when you're gonna, if you're trying to offshore design, if we, if we're gonna take our design and send it to Australia as an example for them to manufacture. I mean, the closer uh the the systems are together like we use a certain kind of printer if they use the same kind of printer, then the design is directly transferable. If they're using a different kind of printer, then there's a lot more.

Speaker 3 [11:43:28 AM]
Frankston's doing that? Is he doing a good job of that over at DOD? Is that you think that is inside the particularly the Five Os countries, but our principal partners is that is that the standard that we try to do that? or no? It's,

Speaker 6 [11:43:41 AM]
it's hard for me to say from my seat. I don't have full visibility of it. I, I would say that my experience so far is not obvious that it's true.

Speaker 3 [11:43:48 AM]
OK, but that's an area we could collaborate on and ask questions about it and improve. Yes, that's right. I think I yield back, Mr.

Speaker 1 [11:43:55 AM]
Thank you, Chairman. I recognize the vice chairman of the full committee, Mr. Heisingen.

Speaker 6 [11:43:59 AM]
Thank you and uh I'm going to uh actually kind of continue where the chair was was going with this a little

Speaker 2 [11:44:06 AM]
bit. Um, uh,

Speaker 7 [11:44:08 AM]
3 of us up here have a, have a side gig of being on the Foreign Affairs Committee as well, and uh and uh I, I had actually been the author of The Aucus submarine,

Speaker 2 [11:44:21 AM]
uh,

Speaker 7 [11:44:22 AM]
authorization and, and we've seen some pushback on that because of the capability, or I'm sorry, not capability but capacity issue, um, and I think it was uh uh Mr. Falen you had talked about sort of the four recommendations that that you and Beehive had, uh, we've kind of gone over the sport, the reauthorization of Title III. We talked a little bit about the uh a more agile non-defense manufacturers being able to uh to qualify. It seems like we're heading down that road of number 4, the Allied initiatives, um, how we align with those, and if you need to expand either one of you expand on that, but I also want to go visit what I think was your number 3 recommendation. talking about high temp alloys being needed and and um and so touch on number 4, with our allies, but then how, how do we then address this, this need for the high temp alloys.

Speaker 2 [11:45:20 AM]
Yeah.

Speaker 6 [11:45:22 AM]
Thank you. So yeah, I think the, the places where the alignment makes sense is, you know, do we have the same materials available at the partner nations, right? So, um, you know, the, the process for how you manufacture these things does require some commonality. So if the alloys are similar composition or preferably the same composition, um, sit meet the same specs that helps the process a lot, um, also, like I said before, the infrastructure like different machines will require different programming, different interfaces, and so having some understanding of what that looks like at each location, would enable you to be able to distribute the manufacturing much, much faster. And then there is still some, there is still some specialized labor at the end of the day. You have to assemble these bits and pieces into an engine and um that takes some time. So if you can, if you can plan these things in advance and kind of manage it as a program, then you will, when you actually need to flip the switch, you get there a whole lot faster. So that's really what I'm referring to we have, do we have current alignment? Um, I think it's yet to be determined from my perspective. I think, how come what needs to happen for you to determine that we have that. Yeah, I, I think, um, again, my experience is limited just to beehive's experience, I would say but I think we're, we're kind of pre-production. Um, and so maybe we're not at the point yet where that would start to happen. I will say we have a contract with the Air Force. Part of that contract is to do uh external production demonstration where we're going to take our design and send it to a third party and have them manufacture it. So I think that's a, that would be a US party to start, so I think that's the first step in that direction. And then ultimately I think it would be, hey, if we want to really take advantage of this forward, I won't call it forward deployment, but like distributed logistics, distributed manufacturing, then the next step would be to pull in these, these friendly nations and, and do a similar process, right? Just to anticipate the problems in advance. I think we haven't done it because the process isn't there yet. Um we're probably a year away from being there, right? So it's something to think about for the future. How do we address this need for high temp alloys. Yeah, so, um, I would say the number one problem we see are things like titanium. Most of the world's titanium comes from Russia and China, unfortunately, and titanium is a really common alloy in aerospace products. It's pretty high temperature capable, it's lightweight. Um, and so there are, uh, North American titanium suppliers that are able to grow, I think investing more in those North American suppliers to scale up and be able to to provide those materials as essential. There's also Canada has, has sources of titanium. There's other friendly nations. I think in the past they haven't been developed because there was a global supply and it wasn't needed, but I think it's one of the big challenges we face, um, I think, uh, Representative Moore, he talked about how in, in North Carolina, there's uh like one of the only copper smelting plants left in the country. Um, there's an element called rhenium which isn't, doesn't exist in nature. The only way you can get it is from the smelting of copper, and that rhenium is really what is like the secret ingredient in a turbine blade, which is the most critical component of a jet engine. So I think things like that, like how do we invest in those sources so that we can do it independently. In the past, I think, you know, some of the, you know, politics change, like some of the countries that we're competitive with now, we weren't as competitive with 20 years ago, and it wasn't a problem, but we've kind of backed ourselves into a corner on a couple of these materials like titanium and

Speaker 2 [11:48:45 AM]
uranium

Speaker 6 [11:48:48 AM]
Yeah, maybe

Speaker 2 [11:48:49 AM]
so Mr. in here,

Speaker 6 [11:48:50 AM]
10 seconds. OK,

Speaker 7 [11:48:52 AM]
if I could add one thing, our solution for this is not nearly as sexy, and everyone who says just in time is going to hate this. What we what we proposed in the DPA funding is not only for the equipment but for buffer stock of material because the lead time is months, months in some cases. So if we put a beautiful factory together and don't have material, we're going to twiddle our thumbs. So our issue was DPA funding, no business wants to hold 6 months of inventory, but if we're going to build a factory in a crisis mode, we better have material on the floor. So that one time buffer to feed out of and feed into would be my suggestion because we don't have the versatility of some of the things, but we would, we would build buffer stop stock and uh DPA funding would be key for that. Thank you.

Speaker 1 [11:49:29 AM]
Good stuff. Thank you. Uh, now recognize, uh, for the final set of questions, Mr. Moore from North Carolina, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Actually, I don't have any questions. Uh, these two witnesses have done an amazing job, uh, addressing, I think, the questions of the members. I just would offer up to either the gentleman if you, if there was something you wanted to say in response to any questions you didn't get a chance to do, uh, I'm gonna allow either of you to use my time to do so.

Speaker 6 [11:49:56 AM]
Uh, honestly, I don't have any questions back for you. Uh, this is my first experience doing a congressional hearing. I think it's been, uh, it was an honor to be able to be with you guys today and understand a little bit how the process works. Uh, like I said, I mean, our experience at Beehive is relatively limited to date. We, we haven't had a Title III contract yet. We're actually in the process of negotiating it now, but um I would say overall our experience with the process has been great. Uh, AFRL's been helpful. The Air Force has been helpful. OSD has been helpful, so just glad to contribute and help where we can. Thank you. Mr. Paxton.

Speaker 2 [11:50:30 AM]
I

Speaker 7 [11:50:30 AM]
would second that. I, it's, it's a pleasure to be here. It's an honor to be here today. Thank you for the invitation. I appreciate the chance to verbalize and share some of the thoughts that we have every day in our factory, and I appreciate your time and your commitment to hear that, and I would say if there was one word I could use, it's urgency. Don't overestimate capability because you opened a checkbook. It may not buy time. So urgency is my message today. Thank you.

Speaker 3 [11:50:53 AM]
With the gentleman,

Speaker 2 [11:50:53 AM]
you. Absolutely.

Speaker 3 [11:50:55 AM]
Just curious on the stockba comment you raised, I thought it was quite a good one and uh you have your own micro parochial interests on stockpiles. but I think it would be good, Mr. Chairman, if we got DOD to send us, uh, if it's classified or unclassified, you know, an analysis of US stockpiles and these critical minerals, but Mr. Triton, do you want to comment on stockpiles, uh, a little further, and I'll yield back to my friend after your answer.

Speaker 7 [11:51:21 AM]
Yes, because we, we speak about materials and that could go from the base alloys. Uh, it could be these titanium sponge to make titanium. It could be nickel-based alloys for high temperature alloys. We can talk about the microelements of mining, but we can also talk about stockpiles of ra w material, but before we can machine it, we may have to go through processes such as forging, rolling mills, etc. So when we talk about lead time, there's a wide variety of saying, hey, we have material, but that doesn't mean it's ready to go into a factory. So these multi-month lead times and some of these constraints like a forging house or a casting facility. These all have to be considered. So the reality in our push is to be vertically integrated so we weren't dependent on outside services to be able to meet your needs and that material and that stockpile is really counterintuitive to typical business practice We don't want material sitting too much, but in this case, because urgency of timing,

Speaker 2 [11:52:10 AM]
I

Speaker 7 [11:52:10 AM]
think it's a smart use of funds to buy that time and feed out of it. Once you do it one time, you don't have to do it twice. The buffer remains, it's first in, first out. You have to buy it once though, and that's where the DPA funds could be very handy.

Speaker 2 [11:52:24 AM]
Um,

Speaker 1 [11:52:26 AM]
I want to thank, uh, my colleagues. I want to thank our witnesses. I thank the staff that did all the work, uh, both in the house, but here at Wright Patterson Air Force Base and out at the DOD, uh, really nice to do a field hearing and bring this out in the community. I think it's a great way to highlight the capabilities really from around the country, but you know, in particular, again right here in the heart of it all in Ohio, and, uh, the great capabilities at Wright Patterson Air Force Base and our own supply chain, but we have a huge challenge. It's great to see that we're talking about a whole of nation approach to it and um and also with our allies and uh so uh without objection, all members will have 5 legislative days to submit additional written questions to the chairman. Uh, the questions will be forwarded to the witnesses for their response. Witnesses, if you get them, please respond no later than September 17th. The hearing now is adjourned.

>> Okay. Thank you. Okay. We're good. 

[2:10:29 PM]

>> Hi, folks. Um, as you can probably tell, there's still. Oh, there's the chairman. 

[2:11:38 PM]

>> Okay. 
>> Okay. 
>> All right. Good afternoon everybody. Um, I want to welcome you to this afternoon's hearing on the human rights implications of anti foreign non-governmental organization, ngos, uh, laws, uh, threats to civil society have long been a focus of this commission. And we held hearings on laws restricting ngos in 2012 and in 2017, as well as many other country specific hearings. We revisit this issue today because of the recent proliferation of laws targeting foreign ngos. Their purpose is clear, and I quote senator James Risch, now the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee, who said at that hearing, uh, on this very topic last September, quote, the tools of choice for authoritarians these days is 

[2:12:39 PM]

anti non-governmental organization laws, also referred to as foreign agent laws. These laws claim to stop foreign influence, but in reality they are used to close the space for civil society and opposition. Autocrats fear the loss of control and this ensures opposing ideas are neither seen nor heard. It should not surprise anyone that the model anti Ngo law was first designed by Vladimir Putin. End quote. Chairman Risch is right. He shows the bipartisan consensus anti-foreign Ngo laws restrict people's freedom of association, undermine civil society and weaken democracy. As he noted, Russia was the first. The European court of human rights ruled that in that that its 2012 foreign agent law violates fundamental rights and bears hallmarks of a totalitarian regime by creating an environment of suspicion toward independent voices. Next was 

[2:13:40 PM]

China, the congressional-executive commission on China, which co-chair Smith and I have been proud to chair, documented how its two 2016 foreign Ngo law serves as a tool of intimidation and suppression of dissenting views. Um and treats many groups and individuals operating in this space as security threats rather than important contributors to Chinese society. Co-chair Smith criticized China's law. I agree Russia's and China's laws are models for many governments, some authoritarian, others on their way who restrict foreign ngos India, Nicaragua, uh, Kyrgyzstan, um Hungary, Slovakia, Israel, Venezuela, Georgia, El Salvador and others. Today, we seek an update on where and how these laws are spreading. We want to understand their impact on people's ability to exercise their basic human rights. Congress charged the Tom lantos human rights commission with 

[2:14:40 PM]

promoting and advocating internationally recognized human rights norms as enshrined in the universal declaration of human rights and international law. That is the lens we apply to anti foreign Ngo laws. Last year, five human rights experts, two from the united nations, one each from regional human rights bodies in the Americas, Africa, southeast Asia and an organization in Europe, provided that answer their joint declaration on protecting the right to freedom of association in light of foreign agents. Foreign influence laws states that anti-foreign Ngo laws cause unjustified and discriminatory interference with the enjoyment of the right to freedom of association and related rights and freedoms, which is disproportionate and unnecessary, and a democratic society. We are fortunate to have one of those experts, um, with us here today, Gina Romero, the un special rapporteur on 

[2:15:42 PM]

freedom of peaceful assembly and of association. And I look forward to sharing their recommendations. Uh, there are some who believe that laws regulating foreign ngos are a good thing, just like autocratic governments do. The congressional executive commission on China summarized the Chinese government rationale by noting, and I'm quoting here, the party increasingly promoted the notion that civil society, including religious groups, was especially susceptible to foreign influence and infiltration. End quote. We hear this same justification today. Protection against so-called foreign influence is a pretext to close ngos, shrinking civic space and enhance a government's social control. Let us be skeptical of arguments praising laws passed by governments who model theirs on the Chinese communist parties. That is the opposite of human rights advocacy. At these hearings, we ask for ideas for how congress can best 

[2:16:44 PM]

promote human rights. But our moral authority is undermined when our country engages in the same behavior that we criticize of others. Several us states have enacted legislation against foreign influence. Many of these bills target nonprofits. Is this a pretext to. There are many people in many countries who still fight to protect civil society from laws and intended to diminish it. I hope to learn from these brave people, and I look forward to hearing the recommendations of today's experts, and I will be listening to them closely. So we are going to have two panels here. Uh, and the first panel, as I said, is Gina Romero, a national of Columbia who served as the united nations special rapporteur on the rights of freedom, of peaceful assembly and of association, and took up her and took up her functions since April 2024. Previously, she founded the Latin American and caribbean network for democracy and served as 

[2:17:44 PM]

secretary of the civil society pillar of the community of democracies, uh, working with stakeholders in the Americas, Europe, Africa and Asia. A special rapporteur, miss Romero, was involved in the inter-american commission of human rights, bringing voices and inputs of Latin American social actors, including civil society organizations and indigenous and afro descendant communities, to several un mechanisms and mandate holders. She has a degree in government from the international. 
>> This meeting is being recorded. 
>> Well, so they missed the first part of my, um. She has a degree in government and international relations from, uh, externado university in Colombia and a master's diploma in analysis of contemporary political, economic and international affairs from the sorbonne and externado university. Um, so, um, let me begin, miss Romero, with with you and, um, and welcome. 
>> Well, thank you for having 

[2:18:45 PM]

me today. Honorable co-chair, distinguished members of congress, esteemed colleagues, greetings from bogota. I'm honored to appear before you today at the Tom lantos human rights commission hearing. Thank you for convening this vital discussion and for the opportunity to contribute as united nations special rapporteur on the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, uh, the adoption of laws that restrict the rights of freedom of peaceful assembly and association, including the foreign agent legislation, forms part of a broader global trend that has been eroding civil space. These measures signal democratic decline and rising authoritarianism, hostile narratives and anti-rights agendas reinforce these restrictions, targeting civil society organizations, social movements, peaceful protests, and limiting people's ability to associate, advocate, and express dissent. The combination of authoritarianism, propaganda, and anti-rights discourse constitutes one of the most harmful global trends, 

[2:19:48 PM]

undermining fundamental freedoms. Civil society actors are stigmatized as traitors, terrorists, or enemies, uh, damaging reputation, exposing them to violence. The legitimizing their work and cutting off funding while creating a chilling effect that forces activists to withdraw. Particularly at risk. Are Jews, lgbtq organizations and persons, migrants and ethnic and religious minorities. These dynamics are compounded by escalating conflicts, wars, and humanitarian crises worldwide. The rise in violence, armed conflicts, and criminal influence are pressuring the securitization of the public agendas and the adoption of regulation that in many cases, are not considering their impact in the exercise of rights and freedoms and the intensified securitized responses to these challenges foster the false notion of a trade off between human rights and security. But in reality, genuine security cannot be 

[2:20:50 PM]

achieved by weakening fundamental freedoms. A growing global trend is the spread of laws and regulations that restrict the legitimate work of civil society, often justified under the banners of national security, foreign influence or financial transparency, and frequently misusing international standards against money laundering. Financing of terrorism such as the financial action task force. Recommendations. While some of these legislations are well-intended, these laws are frequently poorly designed based on disinformation and stigmatization, and in many cases, as it was mentioned before, these laws are deliberately targeting um organizations working in anti-corruption, uh, on human rights with the aim of suppressing dissent. They are commonly adopted through expedite processes, often during states of emergencies, without meaningful public debate or oversight, and in some cases, uh, such as, for 

[2:21:52 PM]

example, the case of Peru and Paraguay, these laws have been adopted to curtail specific ngos and also as part of authoritarian playbooks. So, for example, in Paraguay, the law to curtail civil society was adopted after a visit that the congressmen who promoted it, uh, did to Hungary. So apparently he came back with, uh, came back with a law like, uh, under in his file. So, so most of these, uh, legislations are built on vague or erroneous definitions. These frameworks impose restrictive mechanisms such as mandatory registration, excessive government control, dissolution of ngos without due process, restrictions of basing, fund raising, and burdensome, burdensome, uh, uh, reporting. Um, the restriction of foreign funding has taken different forms around the world from the extreme case in Cuba, where foreign funding for civil society is criminalized under the penal code, to the now extremely common foreign influence of foreign agent type 

[2:22:53 PM]

laws, uh, that we have countries with these laws in all continents and in all types of governments. Restrictive foreign agent laws disproportionately target associations that promote human rights, democracy, and specifically accountability and anti-corruption by branding activists and organizations as traitors or unpatriotic, uh, governments vilify and discredit the legitimate civil action, eroding trust and shrinking their ability to operate. These measures have fueled attacks, intimidations, and criminalization against human rights defenders, uh, and other perceived at the same time voice uh, by calling them foreign agents, they come often with harmful narratives portraying civil society and these actors as foreign controlled, uh, actors, creating a chilling effect that also silence public, uh, debate, particularly on sensitive issues. The consequences of this legislation have been severe across different contexts. So in Russia's 

[2:23:53 PM]

foreign agent, laws are shuttling prominent ngos in Nicaragua has led the, the, the, the, the registration of over hundreds of organizations in Georgia. Civil society organizations have seen rates and account freezing. Uh, and Venezuela has imposed a system of legislation that is killing civil society. As we speak in India, lgbti organizations and others are unable to receive funding, so they're actually heavily compromised. And other examples that we are going to hear later on. In some places, these, uh, legislations threaten to criminalize and then jailed civil society representatives and many activists worldwide have been forced into exile. These laws fostered crime, climates of mistrust, fear and hostility and threaten not only activists, but also their families and communities. And the cumulative effect is to jeopardize the existence of associations, um, and and undermining the democratic resilience. It is important to note that stigmatization and persecution 

[2:24:55 PM]

of ngos based on the origin of their funding has intensified following recent us decisions to froze development assistance, issued support orders and elimination of said and Iran. Uh, these actions were exploited abroad to justify tighter restrictions. In Serbia, for example, ngos were raided under the pretext that even the us president were questioning the transparency of foreign funding. Uh, it is essential also to clarify some misconceptions that may be around the adoption or the need for the adoption of this, uh, type of laws. Uh, so the first one, it's very important to take into account the access to resources is not a privilege. It's a right. It's a freedom. It is integral to the freedom of association. But it's also linked with other rights like freedom of religion and belief, for example, as it has been affirmed by multiple un declarations and regional human 

[2:25:55 PM]

rights bodies. Provisions. The second misconception is to understand that security and rights are not mutually exclusive. True security is only possible when freedoms are respected, but also when a clear assessment of where the real dangers are. And the third one is that transparency is welcome, but not when weaponized. So accountability frameworks should be co-designed with civil society, not imposed. Civil society is not perfect, and nor is international cooperation. But extreme regulation is neither appropriate or justifiable to take on the possible changes, challenges and errors. The harm it causes far outweighs any potential benefits. Uh. In conclusion, promoting transparency and accountability is indeed a legitimate aim. But when pursued through laws that are vague, discriminatory, or stigmatizing, the effect is the opposite of what is intended. They work in democracy and reduce society's ability to hold governments accountable, and especially they keep 

[2:26:55 PM]

institutions busy in following the wrong suspects. Civil society is not a threat. It's a cornerstone of democracy life. And I think that that regarding, um, the recommendations and I will end with this, it is very important to take into account three main recommendations. The first one is the call to repeal all the foreign agent laws, especially those that have been adopted. Uh, the second one is to always call for the for the broad and diverse consultation with civil society when the there has been, uh, the study of adoption of any law that will affect the, uh, their action. And the third one is always to promote a risk assessment, a real risk assessment of where the dangers are and then address those risks with specific actions and not with broad, um, with broad regulations. And just end by repeating that security needs to be, uh, like guaranteed, but not with dismantling freedoms 

[2:27:57 PM]

and rights. 
>> Well, thank you very much. Um, and we just have a few questions. Um, let me kind of begin with, um, a topic that you kind of ended with, and that's the whole issue of transparency because, um, the main argument we hear in defense of these, uh, anti Ngo laws is transparency. And I think everybody's for transparency. Right. Um, but is having transparency in itself sufficient to answer the question of whether a law safeguards people's basic human rights? Uh, let me put it a different way. Uh, does the transparency argument itself satisfy the question of whether a law meets human rights standards? And if not, again, what metrics should we use to assess a law? 
>> Well, thanks. That's a great question. And thank you, chair, for for for doing it. The first one is that you are right. Everybody is for transparency including civil society. So what I've seen uh, generally in the, in the when I reviewing this type of laws is that when 

[2:28:59 PM]

they are talking about transparency, they talk about it like requesting transparency for the sector, but without a specific analysis of of all the provisions that already civil society are using to transparent their activities and their, uh, funding and also their action are, are working. So, for example, let's say the case of, of Ecuador that just two weeks ago adopted, uh, legislation to restrict civil society. Uh, when you see the the report that in 2002 and 2022, sorry, the the the government um ended after the review for the financial action task force, the the the the specific report said something very interesting and it says that in the country, the problem of transparency of civil society was not what civil society do, but the capacity of the state to actually follow with the information that the that the civil society was, was, was 

[2:30:01 PM]

disclosing. And also in the analysis of the risk of the sector. So sometimes when you when, when governments ask for transparency, they are not actually they are not saying that a civil society always, uh, always have any type of reporting or registering of their action, but also that in some cases the bottleneck is not in civil society, but it is, um, in, in the government. And then just let me let me end the reply with, with something that I said, uh, very quickly at the end of my presentation. And it is that there is not a real risk assessment of where the risks, for example, for financing, uh, for money laundering or financing terrorism are really in societies. I really doubt that the main problem of, of our, our societies, our civil society, civil society sometimes receive very little funding or funding. That is, that is that is so tied by the 

[2:31:01 PM]

objectives of their activities that they it is nearly impossible to actually use that to money launder big amount of money, because the people who is money laundering is not money laundering money. So in that case, in all the scenarios when you are talking about money laundering, where you are talking about financing terrorism, or when you are talking about, uh, foreign influence, there is always a lack of, of, of a real assessment of where the risks are and which is actually the, the, the real suspect that need to be addressed in some cases, laws for curtailing civil society and for requesting civil society transparency are adopted. While the other major group of private sector actors, including uh, the the enterprises and companies, are not having any new regulation in these times of, of of fighting against crime. So why it is the unbalanced. This is an open question that is always there. 
>> So we have heard reports 

[2:32:03 PM]

that human rights defenders and democracy activists in countries who have had their said contracts or us grants terminated, have been targeted and stigmatized by pro-government actors as hostile foreign forces. Um, can you speak to how anti-foreign Ngo laws, once passed, are used in stigmatization narratives by governments, uh, and government friendly media and voices in these countries? 
>> Yeah, in several ways. So one of them is that the hardest, uh, foreign agent laws required, uh, civil society and journalists and even in some cases, faith based organizations to register as a foreign agent actors, so that from that specific moment, the the whole process of the stigmatization begin. Because then to explain to a basic citizen, a citizen that doesn't understand much about politics, that an organization need to have a registration as a 

[2:33:04 PM]

foreign agent is as if they were like a type of spy, that if they were like, like close to an enemy of the state, and that it is fueling not only violence. So we saw in Georgia, for example, that after the adoption of the foreign agent law, some civil society organizations got, uh, like the, their um, offices attack. And even with the sprite, uh, sending, uh, hate messages against them in some other places, like in Latin America, this can cause, uh, some killings for human rights defenders, because perhaps you and the and the rest of the audience know that Latin America has the highest number of human rights defenders killed, um, in, in the world. And it is a historic number. So when you are, you are tied to, to this harsh, uh, stigma, then that also creates a reaction from others. And sometimes the reaction is that, for example, one, um, landlord will take off, uh, the possibility to keep 

[2:34:05 PM]

renting their space. And in other cases, it could be, uh, the killing we are seeing right now as we speak. Um, uh, that, for example, in Georgia, several organizations are having their assets frozen, uh, because of, of certain investigations around, uh, the, the foreign agent laws. And, you know, that Georgian foreign agent law is, is was the first one. It was a copy of the Russian one. So there are several different impacts. But in general, what happened is that then civil society gets, uh, lose the support from the public, lose the funding that they are receiving. And that is also fueling, uh, wider, uh, repression and even in some cases, criminalization and jail for human rights, um, and civil society organizations, representatives. 
>> Have you observed cases where such laws disproportionately, if not discriminatory, discriminatorily target ngos who have relied on foreign funding for their work as 

[2:35:06 PM]

compared with other sectors who have received foreign financing through investments or other means? Uh, if so, what does that tell us? 
>> Well, this is what I. I always ask when I am, uh, following up the adoption of legislation, uh, that is, uh, that wants to, uh, question the foreign funding from civil society. I always ask, which is the similar regulation that is questioning or opening, uh, for a wider scrutiny. For example, the, uh, the foreign investment on, on, let's say small, uh, or, or medium enterprises and businesses, uh, of for example, startups. And they just I never get the information because at the end what is happening is that that the these laws in some cases are adopted because there is a wide suspicion on the work of civil society. And in most of the cases, this suspicion is created because 

[2:36:07 PM]

these organizations are working on issues such as human rights, uh, defense, and even even just to try to bring some accountability and, and justice and reparations of human rights violations, like in the case of of Peru, the and then in other cases, they are targeting organizations that work on transparency specifically. So that's the case of Hungary. That's the case of of some some countries in Africa. That's the case of Georgia, which are the transparency and accountability organizations or organizations that work on transparency and anti-corruption are the first one that get, for example, the rates or the or the or the investigations and the request for, for um, for more information. So at the end, uh, at the end that is targeting discriminatory, uh, some of the organizations that are working in the more contagious, um, topics and in some other places, the issue is not about transparency, accountability and human rights or rule of law. 

[2:37:08 PM]

In some places, it's, uh, against organizations that work on on lgbti issues or on gender issues and some other, uh, agenda that that are, are perceived by the government, the ruling party or the regime as, as, as, uh, undesirable. 
>> Thank you. Emily, I, I'm going to yield to congresswoman ilhan Omar for questions. 
>> Thank you. Um, I just want to start by thanking our, um, co-chairs for holding this hearing. This is an important and complex topic, very worthy of the commission's time and energy. I think we can all agree that transparency is a good thing, and that many of us have been fighting for greater transparency around foreign funding, uh, for think tanks and other organizations in the United States. But I think we can all also acknowledge that the way these laws are being 

[2:38:08 PM]

used in many countries is not truly about transparency. Most often, transparency is used as a pretext to cover authoritarian governments desire to monitor their critics and shut down their opposition. I think it is not coincidence that the rise of these types of laws is happening in places with leaders that we know are connected to each other through right wing political networks. I'm talking about here. Um, people like, uh, Orban in Hungary and Buckley in el Salvador. Uh, and it's not an accident that many of their talking points were echoed by Marco Rubio and Elon Musk as they shut down huge parts of the us foreign policy structure this year. Uh, special repertoire. Um, Romero, um, I thank you for being here and for all of your tireless work for the defending universal 

[2:39:09 PM]

human rights of assembly and association. Let me start with a basic question. All of these governments are saying these laws are about promoting transparency around foreign influence. How can we know when that isn't true? And what does a when does a law cross the line into violation of human rights? 
>> Thanks again, uh, for the question. Um, I think that it is very, uh, in some cases it's very easy to see where the, uh, um, uh, the, uh, the ill intention it is, uh, by looking not only at the, at the justification of the, of the, uh, bills before they are adopted, but also by, uh, listening to the debates on the adoption of these laws. So in some cases, you can see even 

[2:40:09 PM]

the use of very, uh, very weird words sometimes in, in, in some of the, of these discussions, you can see that they are calling civil society names, uh, like the they are the enemies. They are saying like in each in each country they say different things. Uh, but this is something that that highlights the necessity of always taking care of, which are being the, uh, the, the narratives that are being portrayed around the adoption of these laws. So sometimes the, sometimes it is very easy to see that there, uh, there is a, an ill intention in other cases, uh, the the problem is that the laws are very poor design, and this happens for three main reasons. The first one is because they are they, they, they the people who are drafting the law that sometimes are the governments, uh, they think that they understand the problem. So they 

[2:41:10 PM]

think that, for example, there are a problem, uh, related to uh, let's say, uh, financing of terrorism or, or money laundering. And they, they, they think that because in some other places, some civil society organizations are, are being restricted and then being like paying attention. So perhaps they also have to do it. But then when they when you ask the governments, for example, where is the key risk assessment on the sector or the other actors that are involved in these crimes, they don't have it. So they they kind of create a solution of a problem that is not well defined and is not well understood. And this is the second reason. And the third one is that because these legislations, most of the in most of the cases are a not debated with civil society. So they are not they, they, they, they don't include civil society, uh, voices. And, and sometimes it is important because, uh, governments may know how civil society are, are, 

[2:42:11 PM]

are governed and, and how they are also which requirements for registration they need. So we record requirements for reporting the needs. But congressmen and congresswomen not always know this. So this is why it's very important for civil society to be part of the debates, to also explain what does it mean to report and be transparent in the system that is already there. That always can be improvable, but then not with a very restrictive law and in some of the cases. And that's the case, for example, of El Salvador, and we can mention many others, these legislations are being adopted, um, uh, in, in, in, in regimes that don't have a clear, uh, balance of powers and then with, with urgent, uh, messages that, that restrict entirely even the debate among, uh, congress, uh, in general. Uh, and then and then the idea also for all these legislations, every time 

[2:43:12 PM]

that a legislation wants to, that a government wants to improve or state wants to improve the transparency of a sector, just please do a risk assessment. Second, involve the people that will be, uh, like benefited or or or affected included in that discussion. And three, first, do a very real analysis of the problem and a real analysis of how the solution, in this case a foreign agent law, is actually attending this problem, because in most of the cases they don't. In most of the cases, a foreign agent law actually don't solve anything, because that's not where the problem lies. 
>> Appreciate that answer. Um, we all have seen that many of these governments have likened their laws to Fara here in the United States. Bukele has said it outright. When El Salvador passed their law earlier this year. Um, are there are they right to compare these laws to, uh, Fara? How are they similar? 

[2:44:13 PM]

How are they different? 
>> That's a that's an excellent question. And then, you know, it is not it was not only bukele also in the republika srpska, they were also saying that the law, uh, that they want to adopt the law like the one in the us and even, uh, I think the new Georgia, uh, they adopted first the law that was more close to the Russian. And then they wanted to to, uh, change it for a law that was more, more related to the us law. And I think that the point there is not only the text of a law, but the intention of the law and the implementation of the law. Sometimes these laws, you can read them and they seem like, like not very well, uh, defined. But then they have like these big principles of transparency and accountability and all those issues that are actually very important. But then the problem is how these laws are being used, uh, to persecute very specific, uh, actors. Uh, so far I haven't received cases in the us of 

[2:45:16 PM]

organizations that are being, uh, persecuted, raided, uh, with whose accounts have been frozen and, and undue restrictions of their work based on the, on the foreign agent law. Perhaps there are cases I don't know them. Uh, and in that cases, not only the existence of the law, but also how that law is actually targeted and weaponized by restricting very specific actors, because that is very important in some cases. Uh, well, we have the case of el Salvador that we are going to hear later on in which there is like a wider, um, impact of a wider number of organizations, but in other places it's very specific, which are the organizations that they are going to target. Uh, and then actually that is what happens that that it is like the usual suspects are the ones who then receive the calls for an audit that many others don't. Uh, so at the end, uh, the problem is how these legislations are being targeted. But then let me 

[2:46:18 PM]

also finish with something very important. It is that this new wave of adoption of, of, uh, of foreign agent laws, um, it's it's falling in a moment in, in which there are a lot of process of stigmatization around even the discussion of these laws. And I don't think that that was the, the, the, the, the, uh, what happened in the us when the, when your law was adopted? Uh, so this is a difference. This is why in one of the previous question, I was saying that that that you can see when these laws are ill intended, when you can see that the debate around the law are based on narratives that are hostile and that are stigmatizing, and then are also in some cases based in a, in a, in an ill or poor understanding of the, of the, uh, of the sector in general and the, and the problems that they want to address. But yeah, it has been, it has been quite common now, uh, for certain of the more, uh, 

[2:47:18 PM]

um, authoritarian actors to actually quote the us, uh, legislation. But at the end it is how they promote it and then how they apply it. Uh, what it is, uh, problematic. 
>> And, uh, just finally, um, I'll end with this question to you. Is there a good way to promote transparency, um, without threatening the right to free association? 
>> Yeah. As I mentioned before, I think that the first thing is to try to see what it is already there. I haven't I cannot remember one single, uh, legislation to, uh, promote transparency and accountability in the social sector that actually was presented, uh, with an annex, for example, of which are the procedures that are already there and why those procedures are not, uh, are not useful or are not being, um, impactful for, for example, guaranteeing more transparency in the sector. And, and there 

[2:48:19 PM]

have been no one, I promise you, in all the laws that I've reviewed that are many. They have I haven't been I haven't received one single, uh, for example, annex in which it says, uh, civil society needs to do a, B, C, and those three processes are, uh, insufficient because of Y and Z. Uh, so this is one, the first one and I was mentioning before, and the second one is to, to, to actually see which are the other transparency and accountability actions that civil society do even when they are not mandatory, because there are several civil society organizations or groups of organizations and networks that actually promote self-regulatory regulatory actions for transparency. And then in Latin America, for example, we have at least two, uh, networks of organizations that have been promoting, uh, like positive accountability for civil society for years. And then that is something that 

[2:49:20 PM]

is happening also in, in, in other other continents and other countries. And, and I can remember, for example, some uh, very interesting activities that were done by civil society in Zimbabwe. So at the end, civil society it is this is why, uh, I was saying before that that everybody's for transparency and civil society too, because transparency also helps civil society to, to, to build up around them a better, uh, reputation of their work and can and can help them to explain better what is what they do and what is the impact that they do. And then this is this is the second one is just to try to identify and highlight and promote more this self-regulatory, uh, standards for uh, for transparency and accountability and perhaps some positive, uh, uh, support about these. It is important. And and the third one is just to try to, to understand that civil society is a sector that that has a very specific 

[2:50:21 PM]

characteristics, that is very different to other sectors, and therefore it is more fragile that, uh, like a business or an for profit in general. And this is why every measure that you take that could affect civil society will affected disproportionately higher or more than any other regulation that will, for example, target, uh, for profit because of the, of the of the specific configuration of what a civil society nonprofit is. Uh, so those are precisely like the ideas that I could have now to promote more transparency. And then and then and then to recognize that that the sector is not against transparency. I don't know why there is this idea that civil society just don't want to, to to, uh, put out information that is not true. They do it already. So how can we do it better? This is something that needs to be also addressed with civil society itself. 

[2:51:22 PM]

>> Mr. Romero, we want to thank you for, for for being a witness today. Um, I mean, we're doing this hearing because, um, the proliferation of anti Ngo laws, um, uh, is apparent. Um, and there's, you know, governments that are doing bad things don't want to be held accountable, don't want to be called out. Um, and there's a pattern. And what ends up happening is governments and, you know, um, those allied with certain government forces begin by, uh, attacking the Ngo, um, and then attacking the individuals who work at the Ngo. If that doesn't work to quiet them, then they move forward with these anti Ngo laws. Um, and uh, they make the activities of these ngos, uh, criminal, um, and, um, and, and, and it has a chilling impact on other members of civil society. 

[2:52:22 PM]

People are afraid to speak up if they believe that they too can be subject to, to retribution. And, um, and it's, uh, and it's happening in too many places. Um, and I think one of the things that concerns me, um, and then I'll let you go, uh, is that, um, I don't think that, um, our country and I quite frankly, I don't think that other countries that say that we care about human rights are speaking out, um, clearly on on this matter. Um, yeah. It's easy for us to condemn an Ngo law in, in Russia or China, um, because there's a consensus that, you know, Russia and China are, you know, are bad actors in terms of, um, how they treat their, their people. Um, but we also have to be willing to speak out against countries that we have decent relationships with. And, um, and I'm thinking right now of, 

[2:53:24 PM]

of El Salvador, um, and we're going to talk about that in the next panel. Uh, but I think, I think we have to be consistent. Otherwise we don't have very much credibility, you know, criticizing China or Russia. So, um, so I appreciate your testimony. And, um, and we appreciate your time. And thank you so much. 
>> Thank you to all of you. Uh, I'll stay here for the rest of the panel. 
>> And, uh, and now, um, I'm going to introduce our next panel, and I'm going to probably abbreviate your bios so that we can get right into the testimony. But, uh, doctor suparna choudhry, who's an associate professor in the department of international affairs at Lewis and Clark college, and her research includes human rights, international law and political violence, with a specific focus on the causes and consequences of state persecution of ngos and activists.

>> Great cochairman Adam Smith and esteemed members of the Tom lantos human rights commission. Thank you for organizing this important hearing. The us government and the American people need to understand the dangerous global trend of state crackdown on ngos and how ngos and civil society are responding to such repression. And I appreciate the opportunity to testify before the commission. For over a decade, my research has focused on the causes and consequences of crackdowns on non-profits and civil society organizations, and I found that as of the end of 2023, more than 130 countries have sought to restrict or repress ngos through what I refer to as 

[2:56:26 PM]

administrative crackdown, which has already highlighted is the use of law to create barriers to entry, barriers to funding, and barriers to advocacy by these organizations. And one of these, the reasons these laws have increasingly proliferated around the world is, unlike the open use of state violence, these laws are often framed as regulation rather than repression, and as a result, political leaders are less likely to encounter domestic backlash in response to their passage. Unlike the use of violence, these laws also rarely elicit threats of withdrawal of aid or assistance and laws that restrict the ability of ngos to acquire funds from abroad or engage in vaguely defined political activities have especially proliferated. Over 100 countries, including Russia, Egypt, Hungary, Georgia, among others, have some form of prohibitions or restrictions against ngos acquiring funding from abroad and throughout the world. These laws have had a 

[2:57:26 PM]

chilling impact on the operation of ngos, focusing on a variety of issues, including human rights, media freedom, political advocacy, promotion of democracy, and even those providing developmental aid and services such as health and education to women and children. Many groups have shut down. Others have downsized and still others have gone virtual or adapted their missions. Ngos with limited resources and flexibility, those unable to find creative ways to work around repressive laws often end up seizing their programs. Many international ngos end up leaving the country. So, for instance, the 2009 ethiopian charities and societies proclamation act led to the closure of nearly 90% of the groups working on rights issues. As most domestic human rights ngos relied almost exclusively on foreign funds in Bangladesh, ngos with a broad mission ended up restricting themselves to service work and giving up on 

[2:58:27 PM]

their advocacy work. Research from Uganda, Serbia and Cambodia shows that government repression of ngos adversely impacts both advocacy organizations as well as service nonprofits. Moreover, ngos working across a wide swath of issue areas in these countries avoid working in communities both while local government authorities are less likely. Both were local government authorities are likely to repress them, and also where authorities use Ngo rhetoric. These laws have also had a chilling effect on donors. Official aid donors increasingly prefer less risky programing. Research shows that donors committed to political advocacy and democracy promotion reduce funding for advocacy programs by more than 70% in response to new restrictive Ngo laws, and the reduction in aid persists for several years to maintain access to target countries with restricted laws, donors increasingly tame their 

[2:59:27 PM]

programing by avoiding contentious issues such as human rights, media freedom, anti-corruption donors also protectively prioritize partnering with the un or other international organizations. This means local grassroots ngos who have the most knowledge and best local networks to ensure effective programing are left without support. These local groups may even be unable to turn to local philanthropists, who themselves may be deterred from donating to advocacy, media freedom and anti-corruption initiatives due to a fear of retribution from a repressive government. And on a broader level, my research also shows that these restrictive laws can trigger worsening human rights repression. I find that the implementation of these laws, that is not just having them on the books, but building or empowering an agency or ministry to start systematically implementing them, can predict state authorities boasting respect for physical integrity, rights and civil liberties. Targeting these nonprofits thus may set 

[3:00:30 PM]

the groundwork for increasing democratic erosion. To address these growing challenges, especially in the face of many western governments scaling back on official aid for ngos, I offer the following policy recommendations for the us government. First, ensure adequate funding for besieged organizations. The us should protect and restore funding for ngos and activists confronting repressive laws. This effort should include prioritizing emergency funding that includes digital security training, legal and immigration assistance, and social and psychological support. The us should also make resources on digital and physical safety widely accessible to at risk activists reaching beyond those living in cities or working for prominent organizations. Second, ensure consistent reporting in the state department's human rights reports. There have been many differences across administrations. In the state department's country reports on human rights practices, and the most recent 2025 reports no 

[3:01:30 PM]

longer feature sections on freedom of assembly, association, and freedom of movement. More importantly, the section on government posture towards international and nongovernmental monitoring and investigation of retribution and abuses against human rights defenders have also been removed. The lack of such consistent information will impede the creation of a robust response. Comprehensive report. On the other hand, along with raising awareness of this issue, can also serve as important resources for immigration judges in future iterations. These reports should also include a section on challenges facing civil society organizations, which could feature reporting on restrictive laws. Third, continue engagement with international institutions withdrawing from multilateral institutions such as the un human rights council seeds the agenda at this institution to illiberal or undemocratic countries. These countries often threatened retaliation against human rights defenders and ngos that provide important 

[3:02:32 PM]

information to the un human rights council help prepare recommendations to the universal periodic review, rejoining and continuing financial support will help advance investments in multilateral forums that protect human rights defenders and ngos. Fourth model international protections for civil society and democracy by standing against us federal or state bills that undermine the right to peaceful protest, expression and assembly, the un special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights has highlighted how overly broad laws on nonprofits and terrorism have been used to target a wide range of civil society actors and criminalize peaceful activities in defense of minority religious, labor and political rights before enacting similar federal or state laws, legislators should use evidence and recommendations prepared by the human rights treaty bodies, un special procedures mechanisms and the updated recommendations from the financial action task force. Finally, engage the 

[3:03:32 PM]

private sector. My research on crackdowns on human rights groups shows that governments are less likely to repress these groups if they receive large trade inflows into the country. The same governments that attack civic groups receiving foreign funding may also be actively encouraging foreign investment and foreign trade deals, since businesses also have a vested interest in protecting civic space and may be sensitive to negative publicity generated by poor conditions in their supply chains, the us government and its allies may be able to utilize leverage to pressure repressive governments to respect civic freedoms. Thank you for giving me this opportunity and I look forward to your questions. 
>> Thank you very much. Mr. 
>> Chairman. Mcgovern. Congresswoman Omar, uh, thank you so much for having me to testify on this important matter. Um, this briefing is particularly. It's working. Yeah. Thank you. This briefing is particularly timely as 2025 witnessed, actually a considerable deterioration in 

[3:04:34 PM]

the freedom of civic space and actually a rising number of attacks on civil liberties across multiple European nato member states. I will only share basic information about these legislative developments. For the details, please consult my written testimony or I'm at your disposal in the q&a. In Slovakia, an anti Ngo law was passed this spring that places civil society organizations under stricter, I repeat, stricter transparency requirements and obligations than those faced by state institutions. The osce office for democratic institutions and human rights concluded, which is the main human rights watchdog of osce, that such requirements cannot be justified as necessary in any democratic society. The lows real goal is not transparency, but creating a chilling impact on civic activism through extreme administrative burdens. In Bulgaria, the picture is somewhat different, but not less worrying. Since 2020, the country has had seven parliamentary elections. In 

[3:05:34 PM]

most of these short lived parliamentary cycles, Bulgarian radical right parties have introduced five draft laws seeking to restrict the freedom of association, and particularly targeting csos receiving funding from abroad. The most recent draft law, submitted in November 2024 on the registration of foreign agents, follows the blueprint of the Russian foreign agent law, but goes even further in a nato member state than the standards established in Russia. If passed, the law would not only impose registration and labeling requirements on civil society media organizations, but also for citizens solely because they receive income from abroad and influence the public discourse, and it would also ban them from engaging in political activities and from carrying out activities in education and state institutions. Extending the scope of the draft law to natural persons is not only 

[3:06:35 PM]

extreme, it represents a serious infringement on their political rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of expression. In fact, the Bulgarian parliament rejected the draft law in February 2025, but the far right revival party continues to keep its reintroduction on the political agenda. Furthermore, the Bulgarian ministry of justice begun working on a draft transparency law that would equate civic activism with lobbying and impose transparency requirements on csos as burdensome and unjustified. And in the Slovak case, however, the main silent on the freedom of association and civic activism in the European union is the regime of prime minister Orban in Hungary. Hungary was the first eu country to introduce anti Ngo legislation and passed actually not one, but four such laws since 2017. The latest Hungarian law, which was passed in December 2023 on the protection of national sovereignty, established a 

[3:07:36 PM]

government agency, the sovereignty protection office, to gather information on all critical voices in the free media and independent civil society, also permitting the use of surveillance measures carried out by the Hungarian intelligence services. In may this year, however, the Hungarian regime submitted also a fifth piece of anti Ngo legislation, the passage of which was postponed to this September. In this draft law on the transparency of the public sphere, if it enters into force, it will make it outright impossible for csos critical to the government to receive any form of support from abroad, including us federal assistance and dedicated eu funding. What is the logic behind the emergence of anti Ngo legislation in these countries? While some legislation follows the Russian blueprint and at least formally targets funding from abroad, the cases demonstrate that the real target of anti Ngo laws is simply public dissent. They 

[3:08:37 PM]

attack the most prominent and most independent watchdogs of human rights and transparency, fighters against corruption and independent private media, because their criticism is uncomfortable for those in power. The sole purpose of such laws is to repress civil society, weaken a vital check on the abuse of political power, and to tilt the political playing field to the incumbent's advantage. Even when these laws focus on foreign funding, it's not to safeguard national sovereignty from foreign influence. They do it because these illiberal regimes already exercise political control over the distribution of domestic funds for civil society and discourage private donations to critical ngos. Foreign funding in these countries remains the last crucial lifeline that can freely help sustain an independent and critical civil society under the shrinking spaces created by these governments, and combating foreign interference and protecting national sovereignty might be a frequent argument 

[3:09:38 PM]

used by the promoters of these laws to justify them. Yet we shouldn't forget that the countries advancing such measures Hungary and Slovakia particularly, also pursue some of the eu's and nato's most Russia and China friendly foreign and security policies. They appear interested only in constraining funding and influence from the west in combating Chinese influence, including funding for csos and academic institutions, is not among their concerns. In conclusion, uh, let me quote the vice president of the United States, guns, in his well-known speech at the Munich security conference this year, he said, quote, if your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousands of dollars of digital advertising from a foreign country, then it wasn't very strong to begin with, unquote. This point applies to the restriction of foreign funding to ngos as well, and I hope the us administration will not tolerate their existence in 

[3:10:39 PM]

Hungary and Slovakia, nor their potential adoption in Bulgaria. Ultimately, these laws represent a clear infringement on fundamental freedoms, which are central to the American spirit and its founding promises the freedom of association and the freedom of speech. And, uh, what can the United States congress do to address these challenges to these values? Very briefly, in in five points. First, I urge congress to issue a bipartisan condemnation of the existing anti Ngo legislation in Hungary and Slovakia and to warn the Bulgarian and Hungarian governments and parliaments not to adopt the draft laws which are currently under consideration. Second, I encourage members of congress to visit Bulgaria, Hungary and Slovakia and meet with local representatives of independent civil society together. First hand information on the shrinking civic space and the impact of anti Ngo laws in these countries. Third, congress should use the state department reauthorization act to push the department towards 

[3:11:42 PM]

reinstating us financial support for independent civil society and free media in Hungary, Slovakia and Bulgaria, as well as in any future eu and nato member state that adopts a dedicated anti Ngo legislation. Force. Congress should establish the appropriate funding base for such a foreign assistance program through the department of state, foreign operations and related programs appropriations act. And last but not least, congress should request global magnitsky sanctions and section 1731 C provisions against those Hungarian, Slovak, and if the laws are passed, Bulgarian parliamentarians who have officially sponsored these legislative acts, which resulted in gross human rights violations and targeting the main anti-corruption watchdogs in these respective countries, co-chair Mcgovern. Distinguished members, thank you for the opportunity to share my perspective today. Your leadership is critical, and I urge you to use the authority of this commission and the congress of the united 

[3:12:44 PM]

States to address these concerns in allied countries. Thank you. 
>> Thank you very much, miss Mendez. Neal Dunn. 
>> Thank you so much, chair. And and Mcgovern and congresswoman Omar, thank you for the opportunity to testify today on a matter of urgent and growing concern, the repression of civil society through anti Ngo legislation. And as a Central American woman, I speak today on behalf of countless individuals, organizations and communities across two central American countries, Nicaragua and El Salvador, where authoritarian leaning governments and institutions are systematically dismantling civic space. The implementation of Ngo laws in these countries, and indeed globally, is not happening in isolation. Rather, it reflects a broader, coordinated and accelerating trend that threatens human rights, particularly freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Despite country specific differences, a common 

[3:13:45 PM]

trend is clear the rapid closing of civic space through legal repression. Let me begin with Nicaragua. Where? Where since 2018, the Ortega regime has weaponized the law to dismantle civil society. Over 5000 ngos, ngos out of 7000 legally registered in the country, in the country, have been shut down without due process, many of them providing humanitarian aid. This means that at least 75% of the legally registered ngos were shut down in Nicaragua, and the 2020 foreign agents law requires organizations receiving foreign funding to register with the government, together with the special cybercrimes law and broad anti-terrorism statutes, it enables the arbitrary detention and prosecution of civil society leaders. Authorities have also confiscated properties, revoked citizenships, and forced many leaders into exile or prison. 

[3:14:46 PM]

This is not just a bureaucratic overreach. This is a delivery is trying to erase independent voices and cut off communities from vital support. As even universities and religious leaders have been repressed. Now, turning to El Salvador, president bukele is advancing a very similar agenda. In may 2025, the legislative assembly passed a foreign agents law that closely mirrors Nicaragua's. It imposes a 30% tax on international funds and gives the government sweeping powers to suspend or dissolve organizations accused of interfering in undefined internal affairs or public order, while government justifies this law as a as a tool for transparency and sovereignty, it is in reality an effort aimed at silencing critical voices. At least 8000 ngos will be impacted, many of whom are already navigating the 

[3:15:49 PM]

recent loss of us funding. Organizations denouncing corruption, human rights abuses and independent journalism are the most affected. They have faced surveillance, harassment, forced relocation and exile. Since may alone, at least 47 independent journalists, 33 human rights defenders and other critical voices have been forced to flee the country. An exodus on a scale not seen since the civil war. In parallel, El Salvador is increasingly using arbitrary detention. Human rights defenders such as Ruth Lopez have been jailed without evidence or formal charges, simply for speaking out against the government. Lastly, although the situation in Guatemala is different, it deserves mention at 2020. Ngo laws grants the government broad powers to suspend groups it deems disruptive and tighten control over civil society. Although president Alvaro has 

[3:16:49 PM]

pledged to restore democratic norms, he faces relentless obstruction from a corrupt judicial apparatus which has targeted critical voices, forcing many into exile or prison, including journalist Jose rubén zamora, an indigenous leader, Luis Pacheco. Although president president arévalo has not used the law against civil society, he remains on the books. If not reform, it could be reactivated by future governments to suppress civil actors, while the legal infrastructure for repression already in place, the message is clear. Even with a democratic president in office, authoritarian tendencies can persist when institutions remain captured, while transparency and adherence to legal standards are essential for ngos, attacks on civil society are also attacks on democracy itself. Let me close with some recommendations for congress. First, speak out in defense of 

[3:17:50 PM]

civil society organizations that are being unjustly impacted by Ngo legislation to second, sorry, tie us foreign assistance to these governments to clear human rights benchmarks, including the reversal of repressive laws. Third, increase us foreign assistance to provide direct support to civil society, including those operating in exile. Fourth, make use of individual sanctions against officials responsible for violence and persecution against critical voices. Civil society organizations are not just institutions. They support local communities, promote civic engagement, and hold governments accountable. Without a vibrant, protected civic space, no democracy can survive. Thank you and I look forward for your questions. 
>> Thank you very much, Mr. Shellenberger. 
>> Thank you. 
>> Very much. And oops, is this on? Thank you very much. And thank you for inviting my testimony. Nice to meet you. Chair Mcgovern and executive committee chair, uh, representative Omar, um, I just want to pull back a bit and 

[3:18:51 PM]

just make a very simple point, which is I think we would all agree that there are some ngos that do great work and that we support, and then there are some ngos that don't do work that most of us, I think would would appreciate, in part because they're doing work, for example, advocating censorship or advocating that certain political candidates aren't allowed to run for office. This is, um, I'm been working for ngos my entire life. I think it's important to have that understanding, to know that, for example, we see currently we've seen in the United States, Brazil, the European union, ngos that have worked with governments to demand censorship of speech that is legal as protected under the first amendment of the constitution of the united States, for example, um, it's important to remember that ngos, despite their name, many of them are funded by the us government. German Marshall fund is heavily funded by the us government. German Marshall fund is a is an instrument of 

[3:19:52 PM]

us statecraft. It's not the case that the German Marshall fund is an independent Ngo in that sense. Um, I worked in Brazil in 1992 for the sociedade de defesa humans um, which was a local human rights group supported by the Ford foundation. I loved it, it was great. Uh, we were a foreign funded Ngo, and everybody on staff worked to get out the vote for the workers party. That was just part of what you did at the Ngo. So, um, we have strict rules in the united States around what ngos can do. Anybody that has run a nonprofit knows what these rules are. You can't endorse political candidates and get involved in political campaigns. There are very strict limits on the amount of lobbying you have to do in terms of extreme administrative burdens. Try advocating for legislations that have a nonprofit. It's quite you have to have attorneys and you have to have paperwork. There's a lot that we require, and I think for good reasons, you have to report your finances. And I would say that, in fact, I think we should go further in the United States. I think that 

[3:20:52 PM]

nonprofits should have to report their donors. Right now, nonprofits can keep, uh, they can hide who their donors are. And so we see a lot of political activity in the United States being done ostensibly as non-governmental but advancing a political agenda. We also require, you know, foreign registration. So, I mean, we had a full blown moral panic in the united States between between 2016 and 2019, when the Mueller report came out about foreign interference by the Russians. That was like a huge concern. So is it so mysterious to us that we would see countries where the United States has been traditionally involved in regime change operations, in operations aimed at destabilizing governments, that you would see governments there saying, hey, maybe we'll take a second look at these ngos. I'm not saying they're right. I agree that with many of the points you're making about the repression in some of these countries, but I do think having some understanding of where that's coming from, you're talking about nearly 80 years of the us being involved in regime change activities through ngos. This is not some secret history. This is all 

[3:21:52 PM]

been revealed by CIA archives, us government support for trade unions, for example, involved a CIA support for trade unions, for example, in Latin America and other countries, uh, us government support for student associations, CIA support for student associations in foreign countries. So I think we should be honest about we're dealing. I think that the reaction that you're seeing from these countries is a reaction to 80 years of us government and other countries interference in their elections. Um, I also just want to point out, I just think that some of the concerns here are quite selective. We're in a situation right now where the front runner in the Romanian presidential election was not allowed to run for president. The current front runner in the French presidential election is not being allowed to run for president. The current frontrunner in the Brazilian election is not being allowed to run for president. And in Germany, they've just disallowed a mayor from competing in the in the upcoming elections. Why did this matter? Because the people that made the case to not allow those candidates to run were ngos. So are we really in favor of the Ngo advocacy of that 

[3:22:53 PM]

sort of political interference? I don't think so. I think most of us would see that, um, as, as, as quite counter to American values. I would also say there's sort of claims of harassment that they're criticizing the CIA, the criticizing the ngos. Are we really so concerned that there that politicians express free speech and criticizing ngos? I mean, is that what we're saying is that the ngos should sort of treat them with kid gloves and not not and like, pretend like they're not participating in local political campaigns. That doesn't seem very sensible. One of the groups in the united States, the Ngo that claimed harassment, uh, was the Stanford internet observatory, which was funded by the national science foundation. They had their special portal hooked up to Twitter. We discovered this in the Twitter files to demand censorship of legally protected speech in the United States. Ultimately, when we exposed all of this, the donors, the San Fernando observatory, they pulled their money. But the whole time they were accusing us of harassment for just exposing what they had done, uh, through the Twitter files. So I think some of these 

[3:23:55 PM]

claims should fall on deaf ears. Um, you know, I, I would just also say, look, we had we saw what happened with said. We discovered, for example, that it was it had basically created this group called the organized crime and corruption reporting project. Um, that that there was it was acting as an intermediary to the intelligence community to make public financial documents, financial information. That's not a secret. We gave $500 million to something called internews to do so-called journalism in Ngo journalism in other countries. Um, this is not just about sort of the ways in which regime change and destabilization efforts are sort of masked as innocent Ngo human rights reporting. It's also about dependency. So even if you support those activities, I think to the point that Daniel made, it's very important, which is that, um, you know, you say these ngos are entirely dependent on foreign funding. Well, maybe that's a problem or not entirely so heavily dependent on foreign funding. That's a problem. If they're heavily dependent on foreign funding, you need some sort of domestic, 

[3:24:57 PM]

uh, base in order to have legitimacy as a truly Ngo organization working in those countries. That's true whether you're combating HIV AIDS or whether that you're doing whether or not you're working on human rights issues, um, that's a fundamental legitimacy question. We shouldn't be simply propping up groups that don't have any local constituency or legitimacy or funding from those countries. Finally, I'll just end by saying I do hope the foreign affairs committee does consider expanding magnitsky sanctions against the judges in Brazil, who are, uh, in the process of essentially preventing a presidential candidate from running for office. The magnitsky sanctions were imposed against the supreme court justice there, who's overseen censorship and overseeing the attacks on democracy in terms of preventing candidates from running. I also would call for a full transparency of all nonprofit donor donations in the United States, long overdue. I don't think we're going to be in a position to criticize countries that act 

[3:25:57 PM]

autocratically and are harassing, or are demanding information from ngos if we're not, um, you know, you know, having some of that transparency here. And I would just say, look, I think we need to really affirm once again our support for free speech and democracy and that really all of the ngos the United States government supports, you know, whether it's the Marshall fund or Brookings or whoever it is, we should insist that they be demanding abroad what we want here, which is strict adherence to the first amendment, which protects a broad range of legal speech and also allowing political candidates to run for office. I don't think our ngos should be involved in supporting any of these activities that are repressing democracy and free speech abroad. Thank you very much. 
>> Thank you. Uh, miss rosha. 
>> Can you hear me? 
>> Yes. Yeah. 
>> Thank you. All right. Uh, chairman Mcgovern, members of 

[3:26:57 PM]

the commission. Um, thank you for inviting me to speak to you today and to testify about laws regulating foreign funding for ngos. I work for ngos for 22 years, mostly in the former soviet union. Most of them were small, with little, if any, money in remote, impoverished regions on the margins of the Ngo industrial complex. Sometimes I worked for large international ngos or foundations, even as a grant maker at times. But today I speak only for myself. I work with inspired, courageous, hardworking people who are showing creativity and resolve. But I also saw a lot that made me uneasy. And over time, my unease coalesced into the perspective that I'm sharing today. This widely used term, Ngo ization, was coined already in the 1990s to describe what happens when, typically in conditions of exclusively foreign funding, civil society morphs into rigid ngos. The resulting ngos sector becomes technocratic, hierarchic, viciously competitive and 

[3:27:59 PM]

alienated from the communities it supposedly represents. Activists within the sector experience ngos as stifling, frustrating, exhausting, and even toxic. The cumulative long longitudinal impact is that civil society ossifies into unaccountable elites. The state is displaced in policy making and service provision, and democracy itself is hollowed out. And this global industry of western donors and their grantees in the global south is a manifestation of the western or western financial, economic, and political power. In the unipolar moment, ngos exploded onto the scene in the 1990s, but a recent article in foreign affairs was titled the end of the age of Ngo, and it shows that the sector has stalled since around 2010, while skepticism about it has been growing. This wasn't all caused by the abrupt demise of U.S. Aid. Leading European bilateral donors have also cut the foreign aid budgets and 

[3:28:59 PM]

specifically the funding of ngos. Even before president trump was elected, the internal malaise of the Ngo sector and the conditions that lead to foreign influence laws are two sides of the same coin, I would argue, and to understand why, we need to look very honestly at the Ngo sector in countries like Georgia, western diplomats know they've created a monster with the Ngo sector, told me one journalist there, um, but they don't know what to do about it. Um, and foreign funded ngos in Georgia have never in the last ten, 20, even 30 years, raised any money from Georgians and ngos. Budgets and size and clout reflects the priorities of foreign donors, not what locals think of that Ngo or how much they appreciate its work. Polls show today that only 22% of Georgians trust ngos, and only 3% of them interact with them. Um, western donors often make it sound as 

[3:30:01 PM]

if we offer unconditional funding to, you know, vibrant civil society to do whatever that vibrant civil society can do best. But in reality, we, these ngos, as contractors for our foreign aid policies, and we make them bid on tenders and then deliver these like technical, highly tightly specified projects. And we must also be honest about the extent to which our financing of other countries ngos is political. Western grant makers strive for high impact and that means drafting laws, designing policies and influencing elections. And donors don't even hide that. Public calls for proposals routinely asked for getting laws passed or reforms adopted. Uh, I know of a recent grant contract between a European donor and a regional Ngo, um, that specified five laws that must be passed um, in Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia. The eu and the us insist that senior appointments in anti-corruption institutions, 

[3:31:01 PM]

courts of last resort and key government offices are made by western funded activists. A long time American philanthropic leader told me about Georgia. We have behaved inappropriately that donors like him had captured politics and policies and corrupted and corroded them. The spread of foreign influence laws across the globe started actually a bit longer than is usually assumed. It started in the 1990s, according to amnesty international. I remember well because I was working in Russia at the time, and Russia adopted its first foreign agent law in 2012, and Russia said, we just modeled this law on the Israeli law that was already in existence at the time, and I think we should not dismiss such laws, you know, in a knee jerk reaction, as you know, autocrats do what autocrats do, autocrats engaging in repression are less than perfectly democratic government can have a perfectly legitimate interest in preventing injurious interference in its 

[3:32:02 PM]

sovereign affairs. Otherwise, the states that we designate insufficiently insufficiently democratic would forfeit their sovereignty to us. Basically, um, the ability of ngos to operate without scrutiny isn't the same as democracy. On the contrary, organizations that influence policy should be rigorously transparent, and I think we would insist on the same in our own democracy. So when now new norms are emerging that suggest the opposite, we should prick our ears. Last year, when Georgia adopted its first law on transparency of foreign influence, the council of Europe's constitutional law advisors, the Venice commission, argued that requiring ngos to disclose foreign financing violates freedom of association, but the regulatory purpose of freedom of association is to protect citizens collective action against the power of the state. Freedom of association was not conceived as a transnational right. It wasn't 

[3:33:04 PM]

conceived to enable confidential transnational financial flows. This new norm defines rich, powerful countries financial access to poor developing countries as a right, and it ignores the ignore the enormous discrepancy of power between them. Uh, the supreme court of India, for example, has rejected this interpretation, quote, receiving foreign donations cannot be an absolute or even a vested right, unquote. So under this new standard, virtually all recent foreign influence laws are always assessed as inappropriate. But their critics never explain what appropriate regulation would look like. There's a flawed logic in all of this, and it goes something like this that after decades and billions of foreign funded democracy promotion, they just haven't worked, and that therefore we must continue them in perpetuity or as long as we see fit. Things are supposedly so bad in countries like Georgia 

[3:34:06 PM]

that only ngos, and only if they have our money, can save Georgian democracy and freedom. And when you hear that, you don't wonder anymore why the age of the Ngo has run its course. Um, and I'm going to end on a personal note. Uh, I don't work anymore in the Ngo industrial complex. Not at least not in the way that I used to. But I'm still in constant contact with many grassroots activists. I learned from them. I try to help them however I can. We commiserate, and we strategize together. Thank you. 
>> Well, um, I'll be honest with you, that's kind of the first time I've ever heard a good spin put on the anti the Russian anti Ngo law. Um, and, um, look, I before I get to questions, I just want to say, um, you know, my experience with ngos, especially in the human rights field, have been, um, have been without their presence, there'd be no 

[3:35:06 PM]

reporting on human rights abuses in countries or there'd be false reporting. I spent a lot of time in El Salvador in the 1980s, and quite frankly, the salvadoran government was not putting out the number of deaths due to, uh, death squads or to, uh, or by the salvadoran military. They were saying everything was was perfect. Um, but there were thoughtful ngos that were going out in the field and documenting, uh, meticulously, the murders and the deaths. Um, there's an organization in El Salvador that I've dealt with recently. Um, I was in El Salvador, um, a year ago last November. And, um, I mean, they are documenting cases of of young people being imprisoned without charges, without due process. Um, and they're also documenting the cases of young people that have 

[3:36:07 PM]

died in prison that the salvadoran government isn't reporting to us. I met with some of their families. But here's the deal. Because of this crackdown on ngos, this intimidation of people doing human rights reporting, the families of those whose loved ones died in prison, you know, um, were afraid to have their name made public for fear of retribution. Uh, and so, you know, I'm not saying every Ngo is perfect, but this, this demonization of ngos, I think is, is just wrong. Is is dangerous. Um, you know, doctor, uh, uh, in your research, what have you found about the state of freedom of association and freedom of expression in countries that passed these anti Ngo laws, does respect for these fundamental rights get better or worse after these laws are implemented? How about 

[3:37:08 PM]

physical integrity? Rights defenders say that these laws serve legitimate state interests. But if these laws have a negative effect on people's ability to enjoy their basic rights, shouldn't we conclude that governments are failing to protect human rights and their implementation? 
>> Yeah. Thank you for that question. Um, so one thing that I want to just say off the bat is because a lot of these laws are recent, um, a lot of our research is only looking at short to medium term impacts, not long term impacts, but at least in terms of the short and medium term impacts. Um, it's not just the passage of these laws, it's how they are implemented that has a negative effect on physical integrity. Right? So that would be things like freedom from torture, freedom from arbitrary influence, arbitrary violence, um, imprisonment. All of those words and then civil liberties violations also increase. So ultimately it's we are not just 

[3:38:09 PM]

talking about freedom of association and what sort of impact they have on the ngos themselves. Um, they sort of serve as, um, a signaling of worsening certain kinds of human rights violations in the country, which should give us pause because it can, um, perhaps lay the basis for democratic backsliding in these countries. 
>> Um, miss Mendes, dehradun, um, can you describe the process through which the foreign agents law was passed in El Salvador in 2025? And you mentioned the case of human rights defender Ruth Lopez and dozens of others forced into exile, including her Ngo Cristo sol, which I referred to, and the el faro journalists. Um, can you describe how the foreign agents law intersects with other mechanisms the bush administration is using to criminalize or silence dissent? 
>> Yes. So one thing that I wanted to mention is the the real issue is not necessarily the foreign agents law, but the 

[3:39:11 PM]

context and the obviously, the provisions of the law, of course. But I mean that it's important to understand in which context, political context, these laws have been implemented. And in El Salvador the main issue is the high concentration of power of president bukele. He controls the three branches of government. He controls the legislative assembly, he controls the judiciary. So the fact that this law was passed by the ruling party nuevas ideas, with a supermajority without a debate, uh, civil society didn't have the opportunity to comment on that. That law, this law, it was an expedited law which normally these processes are used for emergencies. And it was passed less than 4 in 4 weeks. And so the main concern here is about is understanding that in el Salvador there are not independent institutions. So these foreign agents law creates a foreign register. But 

[3:40:14 PM]

these foreign register will be in charge of people that are aligned with Buckley, and it will be subject to arbitrary interpretation of which ngos are, um, following up the law and which ones are not. And the fact that Buckley has um, increasingly just targeting critical voices just because they are speaking out the truth. El faro and Cristo Sal, as you mentioned, they have documented human rights violations. They have documented the conditions in prisons under the state of exception. And they have documented corruption. Um, so another thing that I wanted to mention in analyzing the context in El Salvador is that as I'm as I mentioned, one thing is that since 2022, el Salvador is under under a state of exception and a state of emergency that suspend civil liberties. And so the state of exception was supposed to be a 

[3:41:15 PM]

temporary measure to, um, tackle a gang related violence. But so far it has been used as a tool for repression as well. Ruth Lopez, she's in on repression. Why is she being using this, this criminal model as she was a gang member? She was a human rights defender denouncing corruption. And she is prosecuting her using the state of exception, which means suspending her civil liberties and due process. This is one example. Um, another example, for instance, is how um bukele has implemented like a digital intimidation. Uh, if you see in social media, for instance, anyone who makes a critique against bukele is attacked with a narrative that human rights organizations, ngos, journalists, as el faro, are supporting gangs. Even myself have been I have been attacked 

[3:42:16 PM]

by the government saying that I am a human rights defender and that that I defend gangs members in El Salvador. So. Um, and so it's very problematic how in Salvador. He's also this has led for self-censorship. A recent independent poll showed that at least 60% of people are feared to speak out. So this chilling effect of fear is goes beyond how bukele is attacking dissident voices. Because people are fear to speak. And so this points out to the fact that, uh, in some environments, citizens are. Support government because it is undeniable that is popular. But it coexists with the fear that they have for their own government. 
>> Yeah, I appreciate that. Uh, 

[3:43:16 PM]

Mr. Hagedorn, um, you know, I don't know if you want to defend the German Marshall fund, but you can. But, uh, but my question is, how would you label Hungary's form of government? I mean, is this something Americans should emulate? Can you talk about the powers of the sovereignty protection office? Uh, what? The powers it's been given to surveil and gather information on people and organizations. And what are the human rights implications? Is this a structure the United States should adopt? 
>> Thank you so much, culture. I think there is no need to defend my organization. Um, as far as I'm aware, we are compliant with all existing us legal regulations. And anyhow, I think we have listened to a couple of distorted arguments and, uh, and baseless accusations. So if you allow me, I just would like to start with one statement. None of these countries I am covering the anti Ngo laws created actually a framework for transparency of Ngo funding in an empty space because those because those regulations were non-existing. 

[3:44:18 PM]

It's practically the opposite in all of these countries. Very detailed laws regulated already the financial reporting obligations of of ngos. And in all of the cases I know, both in my organization and all of the Hungarian, Slovak and Bulgarian ngos we supported, transparency was a guideline that was followed actually on a voluntary basis by these ngos. They disclosed their donors. So the Hungarian sovereignty protection office doesn't need to use surveillance methods to actually find out who are the donors, because those are on the websites of the organizations. Um, you ask me how to label, uh, the government of the country Hungary. I am citizen of this is an electoral autocracy. Uh, full stop. I think it's the right of every us citizen to decide whether it's really a blueprint to be emulated in practically the oldest democracy of the world. Um, with regard to the to the 

[3:45:20 PM]

sovereignty protection office and, and its powers, it was already mentioned today that the most of these anti Ngo laws are pretty vague. This is not a bias. It's a feature because this allows actually the arbitrary and discretional and discriminatory use of state powers. I was mentioned several times on uh in in the reports of the sovereignty protection office. Of course, I don't have information whether I was put under surveillance. Uh, but it's a matter of fact that these measures create a chilling, chilling effect on civil society in a country where actually two thirds of the media is under the control of the governing party, which is clearly able to determine and control the public discourse. If civil society organizations are put forward as concepts of public enemies, of course, this will resonate 

[3:46:21 PM]

actually with a large part of the Hungarian electorate with all of the consequences. I found it very interesting to see if actually libertarian minded thinkers try to defend or basic freedoms from civil society organizations. I would actually give free hand, uh, for all those state actors who, in a documented way, have suppressed fundamental freedoms in the alliance system of the United States for years. Um, I would like to conclude, actually with two further remarks. It was mentioned that we never provide actually positive blueprints. How regulations of anti of of transparency laws should look like. I have a very clear recommendation provide actually effective legal remedy because I think this is what differentiates the model of the United States from all of the central European countries. I know the Hungarian and the 

[3:47:22 PM]

Georgian anti Ngo laws are actually more restrictive than the Russian one. Why? Because they straightforwardly deny the opportunity for legal remedy to actually appeal against the decisions of the sovereignty protection office in Hungary, or appeal against the decision of Georgian authorities, uh, if they would like to suppress, uh, ngos. And and last but not least, I would like to because it became in some way personal. I believe in personal integrity. I don't think that the source of my income is determining my position, and I apply these standards actually to all of my fellow thinkers. I don't believe that if Mr. Schellenberg is talking in Hungary on the invitation of the Hungarian government on a trip that is paid by the Hungarian government, then, then he would represent actually the Hungarian government's position. I think he has the integrity to speak for himself. I would like to 

[3:48:23 PM]

receive the same respect that he would actually trust, the same level of academic integrity, uh, to all of his fellows in the academic community. Thank you so much. 
>> I think I would like to jump in for a second here, because it's important for me to clarify is that it would be okay. 
>> Mr. Shellenberger is going to respond first. No. 
>> Okay, good. 
>> Great. Um, just just pull back a little bit. I think there's probably very broad agreement. I mean, even among people that don't agree in here that what you want is you want the ngos to be transparent about where their money is coming from. That's what we do, uh, in the United States. We want to be transparent. If you're working for a foreign government, that's what we do in the United States. Um, that all seems very straightforward. I think nobody wants to call for restrictions on people being able to criticize ngos. That would be, uh, a complete violation of the first amendment. So I'm not sure there's a huge amount of 

[3:49:24 PM]

disagreement about actually kind of what's a good model for for how you treat ngos. I'm bigger concern about how this was all framed. I mean, here we are in a situation where, you know, Brazil has 213 million people. El Salvador has six. Um, I love El Salvador. I mean, it's great. You know, I love Central America, uh, lived there, went there when I was 17 to help the sandinistas, um, sympathetic to a lot of these issues. Uh, but we're in Brazil, where the ngos, funded by the us government, participated in a censorship industrial complex and in an advocacy crusade, by which I mean the ngos demanded censorship of the government, by the government of people doing speech that everybody here would consider legal. The ngos advocated for my personal criminal investigation, for publishing the Twitter files, which were 100% accurate and legal. And I'm still under criminal investigation in Brazil. Um, they're not letting 

[3:50:25 PM]

their front runner run for for office. That was the case that was made by people in the Ngo sector were in France. The ngos coordinated with president macron. And this was all revealed in the Twitter files France last week coordinated with president macron. The point of what I'm trying to say is, I think. 
>> Because if you're talking about Brazil at the moment, we, the United States, is run by a right wing president. So if the United States is influencing the ngos that are advocating, then Brazil would not be putting their front runner, as you say, in jail. So I'm trying to follow your line of reasoning and like, you've lost us the same stuff, but none of it is resonating at all. 
>> Yeah. So what I'm saying is that the focus here has been on government mistreatment of ngos with the idea and demands for transparency and accountability by those ngos. And I'm saying those ngos aren't always 

[3:51:25 PM]

pushing for human rights and democracy. And I've given a bunch of very specific examples of that. So the fundamental assumption here of this hearing is that the ngos are being persecuted and that's that, or they're being criticized or being asked for transparency, and that's a bad thing. And I'm saying that there is evidence of ngos, including the ones that we fund. And in terms of I think it's just a I think it's a factual issue that you may not be aware of, which is that, um, those were funded by said. And so obviously that's no longer happening. Yeah. So, so. 
>> So we have a fundamental disagreement. I mean, you don't think ngos are being targeted, uh, wrongly. 
>> Said that? No. You're putting words in my mouth. 
>> I'm. Yeah, yeah. 
>> Um, what I'm trying to say is that you framed this hearing around a very specific set of countries and a very specific set of ngos. That means that it's not a hearing that's actually focused on democracy and human rights and free speech. As it relates to ngos. You're focused on a very selective, biased number of 

[3:52:28 PM]

countries and ngos. And when I try to widen this to a number of other countries, you. 
>> Say, I get it, you like bolsonaro and and, and and that's what that's that's that's why you. 
>> Need to put words in my mouth. 
>> No, that's what I'm hearing. Yeah. But anyway. 
>> Um, and then you dismissed her as saying it was all Russian propaganda. I don't think that's accurate. 
>> I well, that's she just she basically downplayed the Russian Ngo. 
>> But I mean, that's like using that's like using a mccarthyite tactic. I mean. She was raising genuine issues as an Ngo worker. And you dismissed it as Russian talking point? 
>> No. When she said when she when she downplayed, uh, the severity of the anti Russian Ngo law, I said that was the first time I ever heard it described that way. Those were the specific words. 
>> I mean, that's your interpretation of it. Context. 
>> No, no. One thing that I wanted to to can I just. 
>> Step in or. 
>> He is has been said that there is a bias in how we frame things. But for instance, in the Central American context, you have two different countries, such as Nicaragua and El Salvador. 

[3:53:29 PM]

>> That's right. 
>> So in Nicaragua, the trump administration has been clear, and they have also declared them a Ortega as an enemy of humanity. And, uh, many us administration has imposed sanctions against human rights violators in Nicaragua. But why not in El Salvador? Why China matters in Nicaragua and Honduras and other countries in Central America? But it doesn't matter in in El Salvador. Yeah. So I don't think the the point that I wanted to make here is that we are talking about a, the, the need and promote Independence institutions, the need to promote the separation of powers. And because we all agree that ngos needs to be more transparent, but in contexts where democracy prevails, in contexts where rule of law is respected and not in authoritarian leaning governments. 
>> Thank you. Uh, and miss, you 

[3:54:30 PM]

wanted to respond. And then I'm going to go to miss over. 
>> Yeah. Yeah yeah I do. And it was about the issue of transparency because to me transparency is almost talking about transparency is a category error. Um, yes. There is a problem with lack of transparency. I don't agree with statements that say in most of these countries, ngos are sufficiently transparent. I've worked within these and they keep a tight hold on their information, but especially about the money for a number of reasons. One of the reasons being, and I'm going to be very blunt here, one of the reasons being is they all earn a lot more money than their neighbors, and this would just not go down well. But I think it's a category error because the real problem isn't is that western governments have not just a controlling state in entire countries, civil societies, but like in near 100% stake. And that is what we should be talking about. This is also what what creates a situation that a lot of governments and people in fact, find intolerable or alienating. 

[3:55:33 PM]

>> Okay. Thank you. Um, miss Omar. 
>> Um, thank you. And thank you to, um, the witnesses for for joining us. I would say, as somebody who's, um, traveled quite a lot and actually, uh, partially grew up in a foreign country, almost every body knows where the ngos get their funding. Um, I've rarely seen, um, a said funded entity that people didn't know that it was the us that was funding it, um, or, you know, voice of America. And people didn't understand that it was the United States that was paying for it. So it's it's quite fascinating to hear, um, I guess some of the folks here today, uh, pretend as if the people of those countries and those governments don't know, um, that it is the united States that funds, um, doctor, 

[3:56:34 PM]

uh, Chaudhry, in your testimony, you talked about, um, in 2019, 2009 law in Ethiopia that led to the closure of almost 90% of the rights groups in that country. Uh, this was striking to me because doing an after the atrocities in tigray, one of the problems we had was that the level of documentation was not what we needed in order for us to really act. We were relying on international organizations that didn't have access to tigray. Uh, ethiopian government agencies, diaspora communities, and the videos and eyewitness testimony of people who had successfully fled. So this 2009 law practically wiped out, um, Ethiopia's human rights organizations. And it seemed to me, led directly to that problem. So talk, talk, taking that experience and trying to think of the larger 

[3:57:36 PM]

implications, what are the consequences for you as, uh, lawmakers like myself, of not having local human rights organizations to count on? 
>> Yeah. Thank you for that question. Um, as you pointed out, there are the one of the direct consequences is when there are no human rights organizations and we are talking about an active conflict zone or investigation into potential abuses that might occur. It means that we are not going to have the sort of evidence that we need for legal settings. Um, this is not just a problem. In the instance you've raised. We can see this in examples of Kenya, where after the 2008 2009 election violence, there were a number of human rights groups who were cooperating with the icc officials, um, and providing them evidence. And that was one of the reasons why there have been numerous attempts in Kenya, um, to clamp down on human rights organizations and the funding that they receive from abroad. So the example that you're pointing out also has, 

[3:58:37 PM]

um, parallels elsewhere. So on a very basic level, it means there's not enough information for not just domestic courts, but also international courts. Um, it also means even if we take the standard down, that we don't have enough of what we would consider legal evidence, we perhaps may not even have the evidence for naming and shaming rights violators. And we have a lot of research that shows that, um, this sort of evidence is very important and that shaming really works, especially, um, when conducted against allies. So shaming is not especially effective when conducted against adversaries. In fact, it can even backfire. The research has shown. Um, but when the us um, as uh, previously pointed out, speaks out against countries that you have a decent relationship with or is allied with, that's when shaming is likely to work. So this is where I think the us congress can really step in, um, meet with legislators, 

[3:59:38 PM]

officials in countries that they already have decent or good working relationships with. Um, and that's where I think the biggest sort of change can happen, rather than necessarily focusing on the countries that the us has an adversarial relationship with. 
>> Um, if if we take countries like El Salvador or Hungary or any of the, um, any example that you might prefer, what will this mean in practice? Uh, for the many us laws that depend on accurate human rights reporting. 
>> So can you rephrase your question or. 
>> So obviously we have laws that require, um, for us to have human rights reporting here in the United States. Uh, so the implication of these, these laws would have an implication. Um, I'm assuming, um, on, on our ability to get those reports. 
>> Of course. And I think this is where the embassies can 

[4:00:38 PM]

really step in. So if we are not getting reporting because these human rights groups do not exist, um, the next natural step is that this reporting should exist in the state department country reports on human rights practices. Um, we've obviously seen a massive cut in these reports. Um, this year, um, previously sections on, um, lgbtq defenders had been cut. So, um, bringing these sections back in is really effective for continue tracking. Um, the second obvious avenue would be engaging with the un and the un human rights council. Um, the un has been tracking instances of retaliation and retribution against human rights groups who cooperate with the un, who provide information to the universal periodic review. The universal periodic review reviews every countries human rights records, um, across each four year cycle. And so I think it's really important to track 

[4:01:39 PM]

which groups are facing retaliation for their country, for from their country, for just cooperating with the un. So even if we're not getting local reports, I think us embassies, um, are an important source of reporting and making sure un mechanisms for gathering these reports are also well funded. 
>> Uh, thank you. And, um, my my last question to you is, as you know, last year the house passed a law here, um, that would allow, uh, for a single official at the treasury department to strip nonprofits and ngos of their status on an accusation of supporting terrorism. Um, why should this worry us? 
>> I think this should worry us, because this essentially gives authorities broad powers to harass and silence a wide range of civil society organizations when the us, in fact, already has some of the strictest counterterrorism regulations in the world. Um, I also want to 

[4:02:41 PM]

point out here that the financial action task force provided updated recommendations, um, on the kinds of regulations that the Ngo sector should be subjected to. And they rejected the sort of national measures that H.R. 9495 would essentially entail. They said the entire Ngo sector is never vulnerable to terrorist financing. Um, and ideally, countries should figure out what sub sectors are prone to this, what level of risk do they face? And only after this sort of detailed analysis should be should there be more, um, legislation that's dealing with those particular subsectors. But we should be rejecting these sort of national level, um, measures. Um, and there is, in fact research to support this. A study on 148 countries from 2009 to 2016 failed to find a link between increased cso restrictions and reduced acts of terror. So these sort of 

[4:03:42 PM]

broad based legislations aren't actually reducing terrorism, but are more sort of grounds for harassing particular organizations that, um, authorities might find as threatening to their interests. And we have examples from other countries like Turkey, um, like Sri Lanka, more recently from Zimbabwe. Um, but these sort of terrorist financing, um, language has been used in laws to clamp down on a number of local groups in these countries. 
>> Um. Thank you. 
>> Thank you very much. Look, um, I just want to say in conclusion, because I promised we'd be out of here by four, that, um, I mean, the focus of this commission is on human rights, is upholding standards of human rights. That's that's that's our job. That's what we're supposed. That's what we're supposed to do. And there is a growing concern, maybe not amongst all of us. Um, but many of us here is that, um, the world is retreating from a 

[4:04:42 PM]

commitment to human rights. Um, and there's a concern that our, our, our, our, our government right now is retreating from upholding a high standard of human rights. I mean, the answers to a lot of the questions and the debates that we've had here today can be found in the international human rights standards. As miss Romero, uh, started, uh, with, uh, on the on the opening panel, uh, and, um, and again, um, you know, I think a lot of what we're seeing in terms of the, the anti Ngo laws, um, uh, is not about a reaction to American imperialism or not about, uh, a, you know, a negative, uh, opinion of the United States, per se. Um, it is basically a reaction to the fact that some of these governments don't want to be called out on their human rights record. Um, you know, uh, and I think and I think part of our job in this commission is to make sure that, um, uh, the 

[4:05:44 PM]

people are not forgotten, people who are being repressed and oppressed, people who are being mistreated, um, you know, are not are not forgotten. So, um, I appreciate everybody's participation here today. Um, I know Mr. Smith wanted to be here, but I think, uh, he has some amendments on the floor. Um, and, uh, but again, I thank everybody for being here. And the hearing is closed. Thank you.

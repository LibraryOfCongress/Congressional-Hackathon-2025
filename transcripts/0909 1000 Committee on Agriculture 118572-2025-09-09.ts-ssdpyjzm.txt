a family tax bill, or H.R. One, and dispel some of the false narratives. I know we will hear in this room today. First and foremost, H.R. One protects and strengthens snap's ability to serve our most vulnerable neighbors in need. We are stopping federal and state executive overreach that is eroded once bipartisan work requirements for able bodied adults without young children. We are finally creating real 

[10:09:45 AM]

state options are a critical way for states to tailor snap to their unique needs and the needs of the people they serve. I am concerned that snap eligibility and accessibility. Now that states carry an enormous burden of the administrative and benefits costs, shifts will create additional burdens for individuals. Broad based categorical eligibility, for example, is a state option that 45 states and territories, red states and blue states alike, used to ease snap benefit cliffs. It allows participants a slight raise at work, or pick up an extra shift to continue to receive food assistance. Instead of getting kicked off the program entirely and left with less money than before. It also allows snap households to save more than $3,000, the standard asset limit for snap, which is not even enough to cover first and last month's rent. For most families in any part of this country. But because of the one big beautiful bill act, states might be forced to opt out, 

[10:10:45 AM]

kicking working families off of off of the much needed supports they need. And by helping this critical state option. Excuse me kicking working families help by this critical state option off snap to pay for the costs pushed onto them. I look forward to this hearing today and to hearing from the witnesses about what state options are most helpful to them in the communities they represent, and how these options may be impacted by the immense financial strain that the one big beautiful bill act passed by Republicans in congress this July have put on states and put our states and counties under, and how they believe this issue should be addressed. I welcome your testimony today and hope that at the end of this hearing, we can begin to not only illuminate, outline, but address, uh, not only the issue, but come up with I yield back. 
>> Thank you, Mrs. Hayes from 

[10:11:46 AM]

Minnesota ranking member Craig, for any opening comments you'd like to make. 
>> Uh, thank you, Mr. Fenstad. Um, I suspect perhaps that one of the only things you and I are going to agree on today is skol. Vikings. Uh, so I will say that just at the start of this hearing, uh, this morning, um, thank you for allowing me to start, uh, the conversation here today. And thank you to our fantastic ranking member of the subcommittee. Thank you. To our witnesses in particular, um, this is the first subcommittee hearing of this congress. You heard me right. The first subcommittee hearing on nutrition and foreign agriculture. Yes. There were no subcommittee hearings before my colleagues cut food assistance by $186 billion through the Republican budget earlier this year. And, um, my colleague on the other side of the aisle just called it a name that I don't even recognize the bill. It wasn't the name of the bill. It's appropriate that we are 

[10:12:46 AM]

serving on the ag committee, that I'm the ranking member of the ag committee. But you cannot put lipstick on that pig of a bill, and the American people know it. We cannot talk about state options without putting them in the broader context of that partizan process, which resulted in massive unfunded mandate onto states administrators here last week in DC, counties in my state are wondering how they'll successfully make the programmatic changes demanded by the Republican budget while also cutting staff due to the major reduction in administration, administrative funding. A reduced workforce also makes it harder to participate in state options that make program operations more effective and efficient. The combinations of added red tape and paperwork, program changes, and fewer staff create a perfect storm that will send 

[10:13:47 AM]

states error rate upward, putting states at risk of being fined millions of dollars by the federal government. In effect, Republicans cut their resources and then punish them when overworked staff make more errors. Administering an increasingly complicated program. None of these changes help reduce hunger in our communities. Seniors who rely on snap to stay healthy and live independently, parents who use snap to keep their children fed. Veterans struggling while finding stable housing or employment, who use staff to keep food on the table, do not benefit from states being intentionally overwhelmed and under-resourced by a 

[11:29:46 AM]

designed to protect in reading in the testimony that you submitted, miss Smith, you mentioned in your testimony that you manage a, quote, basic snap program in Wyoming. Can you just expand on what you mean by that and how that has contributed to your state's low payment error rate? 
>> Mr. Chairman, representative. Um, the reference to a basic program really comes down to options and waivers that we pursue. Um, also in my testimony, I noted that any type of implementation of an option or a waiver can be disruptive to, um, the practices in the field and then therefore felt then in our error rate. So when I say minimal, I really do mean that we, as I've testified here earlier, we really do try to pinpoint what the problem is that we're trying to solve and then implement the appropriate 

[11:30:48 AM]

option or waiver solution based on that. Um, that is the best way for us to be able to administer within our means, so to speak. Um, we we do not have the luxury of a lot of staff to be able to, um, you know, be as innovative as I think maybe we would like to be. But the reality is, is that we operate a constrained program. 
>> Well, it sounds like Wyoming snap program. While it may be basic when compared to other states, uh, actually is working better, uh, than most other programs. And it seems to me that, uh, this is somewhat of a good model that other states should follow. And again, I'm grateful for all of you on the panel. I'm grateful for your time and your willingness to come and share with us today. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
>> Thank you. The chair now 

[11:38:04 AM]

it's a program paid for by American citizens, for American citizens. And I think that we can agree on that. And I think that's that's wonderful. Um, and but there's room for improvement and the error rates, uh, the initial idea was to charge every state 25%. If for error rates. And I strenuously objected to that. And we got it focused in a tiered system, uh, to focus on the individual state's error rates to. And the purpose of that is not to remove people from the programs. The purpose of that is to encourage responsible bureaucracy, and that can be done. And people are starting to feel the heat and they're focusing on that. So check this out. Uh, the state of Wisconsin $38.52 per month to administer this program, a month per person to administer these programs, so that's twice as much. So, miss Bivens, can you can you explain to me the difference? Why would it cost $97 in the state of Ohio to 

[11:39:05 AM]

administer these programs when it costs $38 in the state of Wisconsin? 
>> Thank you, sir. I would say for several reasons. Um, in order to, as you know, um, because you're familiar with Iowa and I can talk about Franklin county. We're a county of 1.3 million people. We have about 183,000 folks that are that are receiving snap. Yeah. It requires a staff person to be trained to administer, to do all the things in order to ensure that that residents has what they need regarding their ebt card, in addition to what I will say is, and I'm not familiar with the cost of living in your state, so I apologize. Cost of living, um, across the country has increased. 
>> Okay, so, miss Bivins, the cost of living has absolutely nothing to do with the administration of the program. So hold on a second. Now let's go. We're going to go back to Wisconsin. Uh, Mr. Chairman, I request unanimous consent to enter this little, little bit of paperwork I got in the record. 
>> Without objection. 
>> Alright, so check this out. Here's the state of Wisconsin, and we are one of the most 

[11:40:06 AM]

efficient states in the entire country. They're spending $4.4 million to issue ebt cards, $1.8 million for quality control, $200,000 for management evaluation, $4.5 million for fraud control. We can agree those are all great things. Now check this out. They're spending 7.3 million. This is under the leadership of Tony Evers or actually his chief of staff in an autopen. They're they're spending $7.3 million for automated data processing development. If it's automatic, why is it still costing $7.3 million? They're spending $42 million for automated data processing operations. If it's automated, why is the state of Wisconsin spending $42 million for an automated process? The purpose of automating things is to make them much more efficient, less expensive. Uh, $1.3 million for fair hearings. I get that now check this one out. The state of Wisconsin under Tony Evers, chief of staff and the autopen, is spending $43.2 million for snap employment and training programs. So snap employment 

[11:41:06 AM]

and training programs are part of snap. And they're they're they're hiding this under administrative costs. Now extrapolate that across the entire nation we're talking about hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars that are being misallocated. And I was the hungry child when I went to sleep. And I don't want and neither do my Democrat colleagues. We don't want a single child to go to bed hungry in the United States of America. But when we're spending 11.122378364, that's we're spending over $11 billion for administrative costs. That's what we need to to nip in the bud so that money goes to the hungry child. And that's what we're trying to get at. There's no viciousness here. We want every single person who needs food assistance in this country to receive it. And that's why we are so adamant about getting rid of stuff like this. That's why we want the state of Ohio to spend $38 a month administering this program, vice $97. And my time has expired. Mr. Chairman, I 

[11:42:07 AM]

yield back. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Excuse me, gentleman from Mr. Chairman. Yes. 
>> We ask the gentleman to share with us what the document was. 
>> Oh, yeah. 
>> We just shared that it was pieces of paper. I don't know if you typed that. What is the. 
>> Mr. Chairman, can I respond? 
>> I speak Wisconsin, so I knew what he was saying, but go ahead. 
>> So, uh, madam ranking member, what this is, it comes from the Wisconsin department of human services, and it is there. It is their grid provided to us. Uh, as far as the breakdown of the administrative costs. So, Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent if I can, uh, enter into the record the paperwork from the Wisconsin department of of human services that details out the administrative costs of the snap program. 
>> Thank you. 
>> You're welcome, ma'am, and thank you for clarifying that. 
>> All right. I'll recognize the gentleman from Alabama. Mr. Figures for five minutes. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and let the record reflect that Mr. Van Orton has agreed to work with us to get the the chip cards, uh, in place. And so we 

[11:43:09 AM]

are we're going to, uh, we're going to do that. I think that's common sense. It's something that's costing real money. Um, you know, it's it's it's really costing real money and having negative effects. Um, I represent, uh, second congressional district in Alabama. Uh, it's one of the poorest congressional districts in this country, about a 1 in 4 rate of snap participation, uh, in my district. And as several of my colleagues have pointed out that under the reconciliation bill, uh, they have said that the people that need the, uh, aid the most, uh, will still get it. Um, but I want to be clear with what we have in our possession in terms of knowledge right now about what happens if a state cannot meet the cost sharing participation, that those people can no longer get it. And so this conversation has shifted totally away, um, from limiting eligibility to certain people to eliminating the program for everyone. Um, that's my understanding of it. 

[11:44:09 AM]

And, miss green, I know you've answered this question already, but is that your understanding of what happens here if a state cannot meet the benefit cost sharing? 
>> Yes. As currently written, if a state cannot meet the benefit cost sharing and the admin cost sharing that they would not be able to operate a snap program. 
>> Miss Bivins, is that your understanding? And miss Smith, is that your understanding? I know we heard some or we saw, um, uh, ranking member Hayes enter something into the record, um, a statement on behalf of, uh, I believe the same organization, the same agency that you work with. But is that your understanding? 
>> Yes, sir. That's our understanding. 
>> So to be clear, to be crystal clear, what this bill did was create the potential for snap programs to no longer exist in any shape, form or fashion in terms of providing snap benefits in states that could not afford to or chose 

[11:45:09 AM]

not to, for whatever reason, meet the cost sharing. Is that is that a fair assessment of that, miss green? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> Miss Bivins. 
>> Yes, it is. 
>> Miss Schmidt. 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> I almost just want to sit in silence to let that sink in. The United States of America just signed into law a bill that will allow states, essentially, to determine whether or not they will provide food assistance to anyone, anyone to federally funded food assistance, to anyone. That would include children. Is that correct, miss Bivins? 
>> Absolutely. 
>> That would include disabled individuals. Is that correct, miss green? 
>> Yes. If they no longer operated a program. 
>> That would include homeless 

[11:46:09 AM]

veterans, is that the case, miss Smith, or would there be some exemption for them? 
>> That's our understanding. Yes. 
>> That's a sad day. That's a sad day when we sit here and look at that and in, in in my district, you know, in my state, it's $172 million would be Alabama's cost sharing, um, requirement, given our most recent error rate of 8.5%, uh, which is something that we need to reassess how that's calculated, because that is not a fair assessment of actual of actual errors. Um, but this bill made no changes that I'm aware of. Um, please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong in terms of how error rates are calculated. Is that correct, miss green? 
>> Yes. 
>> Miss Bivins, is that your understanding as well, miss Schmidt? 
>> Yes, sir. 
>> So I had some questions that my staff prepared for me, and I thank you, Kyla, um, for doing that. But as I sat through this 

[11:47:11 AM]

hearing and the realities of, you know, some of the commentary that's being made and some of the statements and positions, uh, that people have been been taking, I felt the need to highlight the realities, the stark realities of what that of what this bill potentially means in states that, you know, that do not meet the cost sharing. I think we all share the general objective and the hope and the moral value. I would like to think that, um, that we should be feeding hungry families, hungry people and also creating pathways for them to come off food assistance. I am not one that believes poor people want to be poor. Um, but I felt the need to highlight that. So I thank you guys for your response and I yield the balance of my time to the ranking member. 
>> Thank you. I would just like to enter into the record from the usda food and nutrition services. The snap state activity report for fy 2023. And according to this latest data in fy 2023, Ohio's admitted administrative costs per case were $33.31, not the 

[11:48:14 AM]

$90 that was previously stated in this hearing. Um. 
>> Without objection. 
>> Thank you, I yield back. 
>> I now recognize the gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Weed, for five minutes. 
>> Thank you. I want to thank chairman and ranking member Hayes for holding this hearing today. While quite a bit of the rhetoric surrounding today's topic may have you think otherwise, I think all of us on this subcommittee do agree that snap and hunger prevention is important, and that it is even more important that the people who really need the support can get it. With that in mind, I think we can also agree that with all our state's unique needs and interests, it's an overall good thing that each state has the opportunity to customize their snap program. However, it is clear that those options have also moved the program away from what congress has intended. Additionally, I think it has become abundantly clear that some states want to make the program their own, which I think can be a good 

[11:49:15 AM]

thing. But they also want the federal government to foot the bill completely. Take my home state, for example. Since the passage of the working families tax plan, I have heard from the Democrats of my state that we can't afford the changes that the bill made to the program. However, last year, NPR reported that the state had quite the budget surplus, 4.6 billion to be exact. So I would challenge the governor of my state of Wisconsin, Tony Evers, to really prioritize this program the way that he claims to and utilize those funds for that purpose. Like with every other government assistance program, the state should contribute to the benefits, especially if they want a customized snap beyond what the federal law prescribes. So, miss green, can you walk through how each state determines which options that they will utilize? Is it the governors, the state legislature, or a mixture of both? Or is it something else entirely? 
>> Yes. And thank you so much for this question, because if I 

[11:50:16 AM]

can, I'd like to also just go back to what we were just talking about. And that I do think when we're talking about state options, there is still room to look at policy flexibility beyond what's currently allowed in law to make it more feasible for a state to continue operating a program and to look at, um, their eligibility so that they could make it more affordable for the cost share. So I am glad that we're talking about policy options and flexibilities today and the future potential for where we can continue to look at flexibilities in partnership with state agencies. So to your question around how do states decide this? It really is, uh, it can differ across states and across what the issue is. So sometimes, um, again, a policy option, the agency can see that as a priority and raise that to their commissioner and have the governor sign off. Sometimes they need to have that approved by a board at the state, and then sometimes it's actually passed by their state legislature to require them to use it. So for example, uh, in some state legislatures they are required to use bbc, which 

[11:51:18 AM]

we talked about earlier. So that would require a law change. Some also require them, for example, not to be able to use discretionary waivers, which are another work requirement waiver within abod. So it really does differ. 
>> All right. Thank you, miss Schmidt. You paint the picture of a state that operates a lean but incredibly efficient program. Can you explain how Wyoming determines which flexibilities to use without overwhelmingly raising the cost to operate that program? 
>> Mr. Chairman? Representative. Um, yes. We start with what is going to help us, and then we analyze whether it will help us or hurt us. So essentially what we do is we look at what what issues are happening within our program, whether that be around case processing, whether that's around how we organize our work. And then we look for the options that may best fit or 

[11:52:19 AM]

wait for an option to show up that could that could support us. So it's really it's really founded in the data that we that we gather through quality control and through feedback from our, from our clients and also from our field staff and recognizing what is it that may be of best use for us to be able to first be effective and efficient, but also to deliver what we need to deliver. And that's a benefit. So starting with quality control we then work through, um, problem identification. Then from problem identification we look at what strategies are available. Then we then we address those strategies and determine what of those strategies are going to be most appropriate. Do they affect our error rate. That's a consideration we give. Are they politically feasible and palatable with our constituency. That's another factor that will consider. And then we'll start with slow research investigation and then potentially implementation on a pilot level. If we think that 

[11:53:20 AM]

that's an appropriate solution. 
>> All right. Thank you, all three of you for being here for this very important hearing. Mr. Chairman I yield back. 
>> Thank you. I now recognize Mr. Carbajal from California for five minutes. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you to all the witnesses for being here today. Uh, miss Bivins, I represent the central coast of California. And before I came to the congress, I served on the board of supervisors for 12 years as a county supervisor. I got to see firsthand the fiscal challenges counties face, particularly regarding administrative cost burdens. As it relates to snap. In your testimony, you described how the recently enacted one big, beautiful bill, which I call ugly bill, could create additional financial strain on counties instead of easing it. As, you know, California, along with nine other states, delegated administration of snap to its counties, which serve over 34% of snap recipients nationwide. 

[11:54:21 AM]

With the new requirements under this bill, counties will likely face increased responsibilities given that counties already shoulder a large share of the nonfederal administrative costs. Could you elaborate on how this bill's incoming financial burden will impact local county resources and the administration of snap services? 
>> Thank you so much for the question. Um, so the way that this bill has been written in, in although it is not, you know, 100% cost from federal government, every county and every community around this country is dealing with some form of fiscal issue. Counties and communities currently right now rely on tax dollars as well as sales tax dollars. If this were to go in place for our county alone, it would be an additional $7 million, and we would have to make cuts in other areas in order to support residents in our community. And that would be around the 

[11:55:22 AM]

country. And so and how that would impact the administration of the snap benefit. We would have to make some tough decisions on how we would even administer it. If we're going to incur additional, more dollars in order to administer. And as you know, it takes a very long time to train a staff person at least a year to be proficient. So there's always going to be errors because it's not clear proof. And so, you know what this could possibly do to communities and counties is it would lean our budgets, and then we would have make decisions on what other areas do we cut, and then what are those areas? How does that impact the residents in our communities. 
>> So in essence, it's shifting cost burdens to states and local communities. 
>> Absolutely. 
>> Miss Bivins, when snap benefits are reduced, families oftentimes turn to other local support to make ends meet. Can you describe how cuts to snap and counties like your own could impact other services like childcare, housing 

[11:56:23 AM]

assistance and workforce development? And with that strain, looks like for a county budget, which you've already done. But if you could elaborate just a tad more, that'd be great. 
>> Um, currently, right now, when we look at our snap residents, they are experiencing what we know to be our either underemployed, they're not making enough. And so it is because of high housing costs. It is because of high childcare costs. It is because of all the inflation and cost of living. The reason why folks depend on snap benefits. And so, um, if this particularly if we were just to hypothetically say, let's say it goes away, um, in Franklin county or if it's weakened in Franklin county, our state legislator, um, we decreased our food pantry budget by $7 million. So there's not enough food on the pantries in order to even support the decrease in the snap changes. If we were to be extreme and to administer in a different way, or to have it go away. 
>> Thank you. A lot has been 

[11:57:23 AM]

said about fraud and and efficiency, uh, by this administration. And, um, if you really wanted to do that, the big, beautiful, ugly bill would have really addressed that. And it does little to address that issue. Um, we've heard about the rise in ebt card skimming, which leaves families without food assistance they rely on. From your perspective, at the county level, what state options are federal flexibilities would be most effective in helping prevent fraud, while ensuring families can securely access their snap benefits? 
>> And so, from the county perspective, of course, we've talked about it before. The chips, um, leveraging the chip option and also looking at the ebt card, no different than we look at our credit cards or our debit cards from financial institutions, those securities that we put around those cards, many of us receive alerts when we're in other communities that are not familiar with our financial institutions. So looking at ways we can be more 

[11:58:24 AM]

sophisticated or catch up with current day society as it relates to fiscal, um, financial institutions in order to trigger and target fraud when they are stolen. 
>> And, miss Bivins, I'm running out of time. But does the big, beautiful, ugly bill address that in any way, shape or form? Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I'm out of time. I yield back now. 
>> Recognize the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Baird, for five minutes. 
>> Thank you, Mr. Chairman and ranking member. And I appreciate this hearing about exploring state options in snap. And so in that vein, uh, I appreciate all of you witnesses being here, uh, and sharing your ideas. And so I'm going to start with miss Smith. Uh, you mentioned that combat that in order to combat fraud, your team implemented front end eligibility fee. Uh, could you elaborate on the structure of this tool and how it helps investigate potential fraud? And could you additionally explain the difference between this and what you referred to as the pay? Pay and chase model? 

[11:59:29 AM]

>> Mr. Chairman? Representative. Thank you. Um, we first learned about the front end eligibility at the united council on welfare fraud conference. And when we learned about this particular project, we applied to the to fns, the usda, fns for a fraud framework grant. And this was back in August of 2022. We were issued $750,000 in the initial grant. Um, and the biggest part of the grant was used for asset verification. Uh, the original period of the grant was from August of 2022 through September 24th. But because we got a late start, we extended it until March of 2025. So our grant just ended this last spring. We will continue this grant, um, because we did find that it prevented a lot of what you mentioned, which is the pay and chase. So essentially without the grant, we would make a payment, we 

[12:00:31 PM]

would issue a benefit then to discover it was fraudulent and then have to pursue actions in order to retrieve those dollars. Um, it is inefficient for us. It's not a good use of our small staff, um, to be to have to go chase down, but rather looking at potential fraud at the beginning of the case and then making the decision about whether or not that case should be, um, considered for benefits. Not all inappropriate. Not all information that we receive is fraudulently provided. Oftentimes, as was testified earlier, it's a it's a client making a mistake, a misunderstanding on what they thought the question was. So it's also a good way to provide technical assistance to our staff, to help them to be able to ask the questions a little bit more targeted or correctly, so that we can avoid fraud from the very get go. It's a prevention approach, more so than it is a reactive approach. 
>> Thank you. And I you know, I 

[12:01:32 PM]

like the idea of prevention instead of having to try to recover those dollars. So, uh, I commend you for that. Taking that program to take a look at it. Uh, you know, in another area, uh, miss green, I want to ask you. And artificial intelligence is really, really taking off. And it's of interest to me how we might use that. So do you know of any states that use advanced technology to improve efficiency? Uh, what are the biggest barriers that states face in making technological advancements and investments, and how can we help them on the federal level? 
>> Thank you for the question, representative Baird. So our members are also really excited about the potential of using ai or artificial intelligence in snap, especially when they continue to share about challenges with staffing and turnover and really looking at it as an opportunity to help make up for that capacity. Although, of course, it does 

[12:02:32 PM]

take, uh, funding and investment into high quality technology, including for things like user testing, to make sure it works well on the front end. So, uh, to answer the second part of your question first, where are some examples? Are the examples actually right now are pretty limited because as I had mentioned earlier, uh, from our perspective, and what we hear a lot from our members is that the usda food and nutrition service has been pretty reticent to approve abilities to use automation or ai. And and there has been some framework. But really, what our members would like to see is some more direct guidance or guide rails on what they can apply for and to work with them to really make it happen. Where we do see some use is around what non-merit staff can do. So things like if they call into the call center, uh, ivr or integrated voice response can help direct them or help answer some of their questions. I know that naco has shared about this happening in some counties as 

[12:03:33 PM]

well. And um, some starting to use, uh, in their policy manuals or um, things like ocr where you can help to translate a printed document into, uh, computer text. 
>> Well, Mr. Chairman, I got more questions, but I see my time is up, so I yield back. Thank you. 
>> All right. Thank you. I'll now recognize the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Jackson, for five minutes. 
>> Thank you so much, chairman. Thank you. Our ranking member, Mrs. Hayes. Um, let me begin by first acknowledging and thanking all the participants for your testimony and your time today to share with us and also acknowledge the irony before us. We sit here in the agriculture committee and specifically the subcommittee on nutrition. And yet we have before us a sweeping bill that has already become law, that has bypassed our deliberate body and our ability to even weigh in on this discussion. There have been no hearings, no 

[12:04:33 PM]

testimony, no fact finding. This is simply has been legislation by branding. Uh, this bill tells us that it will lift families into dignity through expanded work requirements. But consider the single mother of two in Illinois, where the law is clear, children under 14th may not legally be left alone. The work, the eligibility for students to stay and children to stay at home varies state by state. We come from very diverse states and very diverse backgrounds. Children under 14th may not stay at home alone. Therefore, every additional shift that that mother is asked to take mandated by this bill federally is simultaneously prohibited by our state in Illinois. Isn't this not a level of contradiction, a demand that she cannot meet? That is impossible. The contradiction is very real. The minimum age for children. Illinois is 14. The need parent supervision. Parents with younger children cannot comply 

[12:05:35 PM]

with expanded work requirements unless affordable child care is made available. This bill does not provide any such funding. In effect, it creates a catch 22, meet the federal requirement and violate state law or by or honor state law, and you violate the federal snap eligibility. This is not empowerment. This is entrapment. And finally, the ultimate paradox is the federal government and its pursuit of dignity inadvertently criminalizes the very act of parenting. Mothers are told to work longer hours, the state says, stay at home with your children. What is a mother supposed to do? In the state of Illinois, we have 1.9 million persons that are eligible for snap. Under this reduction in the 50% cost sharing down to 25%, that's going to be an additional $1 billion passed on to our state. We're going to see families go hungry. And lastly is regarding the seniors. I think it's cruel. I put an amendment to try to curtail 

[12:06:37 PM]

this eligibility requirement for the senior citizens, people having to work 60, 70 years of age almost in order to qualify for these benefits. And considering that you have more frequent recertifications online only submissions, some people don't have access to the internet there tighter deadlines. This is a disaster. I want to thank each of you. And I would ask miss Bivins, um, do you think this will. Bill will be practical and enhance its desired goal of feeding more hungry children and seniors in our society? 
>> I do not, I think that thank you for the question, I do not. I think it would require more collective, um, conversation, inclusive conversation from all the systems that you you mentioned prior. In order for it to be effective. 
>> Thank you so much, Mrs. Greene. Um, in your state, can you contrast or compare what we're going to confront with Illinois? Um, on having to have parents stay at home with 

[12:07:38 PM]

children at 14, what will be the state's workaround of that federal law? 
>> Thank you for the question. Speaking on behalf of the country as a national association, I'm not as familiar with individual state laws in terms of, um, whether parents can stay home or not. But I do hear your concern around, um, the additional challenge for states that do have laws like that and the challenge that the mother or anyone in that case would have to weigh. 
>> Miss Schmidt, can you comment on that? On what would be the mother's workaround on complying with state and federal law? That's at a contradiction. 
>> Mister chairman. Representative, Wyoming doesn't have a required law around a minimal age. We really look at the appropriateness of the child, the circumstances. Um, but but to your point, it asks the question about child care and the role of childcare, which for us and our agency is 

[12:08:38 PM]

a core foundational program that supports a lot of this work. So we've taken a very, um, family approach to the work in our agency and have kind of set our standard around home Y home matters as our tagline. And from that, we try to orient all of our programs to think about what is necessary from a collaboration across programs and through communities to support families so children can stay safely at home or elderly can stay safely at home. So it's through those conversations that we would address this problem. It's about what is available locally through our churches, through our community supports, to provide that support to that mother. Looking at programs that are designed specifically around employment for mothers and providing childcare as a response to that so that that child can be safe. Um, we also very much consider kinship and looking to to family supports as an option to what we would 

[12:09:40 PM]

see in that event. 
>> Thank you. My time is expired. I'd like to thank each of you. I wish I could have met you in the hearing and gathered more testimony. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
>> Thank you. I'll now go to recognize the gentleman from Ohio, miss brown, for five minutes. 
>> Uh. Thank you. Chairman and ranking member. Hays. Thank you to our witnesses for being here today. And a special thank you to miss Schmidt and miss Bivins, who are truly on the front lines, making sure families in Wyoming and Ohio can put food on the table. Um, what we've heard today is deeply troubling. Um, the fallout from the one big ugly bill that my Republican colleagues are desperately trying to rebrand after, um, forcing it through this summer only to realize it is worse than we feared. Um, let's be clear. This bill was never about program integrity or rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse. It was about shifting costs onto states so Republicans could hand out more tax cuts to wealthy and the 

[12:10:41 PM]

well-connected. The bill rigs the system by inflating error rates in snap, essentially punishing states and counties for paperwork mistakes, not fraud. Then, to add insult to injury, it slashes the very administrative funding that Ohio needs to hire and retain staff who process applications, correct errors and serve families. That means caseworkers in places like cuyahoga county who already manage the highest caseloads in the state, will be asked to do more with less while facing penalties for mistakes that are inevitable under these conditions, and families across Cleveland will pay the price with longer wait times, more red tape and fewer resources, making it to people who need them. So I want to start off first with you, miss Bevins, and thank you again for all that you do for Ohio. Since Ohio is a county administered snap state where in a uniquely challenging position, these new 

[12:11:42 PM]

costs won't just fall to the state, they'll fall directly on individual counties. In your testimony, you noted that counties have very limited options for generating revenue, relying mostly on property taxes or sales tax. Unfortunately, many now expect they'll have to raise taxes just to keep up. Can you speak to what the immediate impact of these cuts would be on counties and families? And and also, second, if these cuts were delayed, if they were delayed, how much breathing room would it give the counties to plan ahead and soften the blow? 
>> Thank you so much for your question, and I really appreciate the service that you provide to Ohio. So thank you. Um, previously so previous to what I stated earlier, um, these cuts, you know, Franklin county rely heavily on sales tax. And as you know, um, residents across the country are taxed out from property taxes to all types of taxes. So, um, for us, if we were to incur 

[12:12:42 PM]

this shared cost, Franklin county has to make a decision on what we do not fund anymore. And what does that look like? So, um, it would be tremendous and it would be debilitating to our human service delivery system. 
>> And so you you also mentioned that you would have to come up with roughly $7.5 million a year to cover the new snap administrative costs, and that's not even accounting for the increased cost share that is coming as well. Um, this is a massive number, and counties just don't have unlimited budgets. I used to work at the county, so I know, miss Bivins, what other critical services could be at risk if that money has to be diverted? Workforce training, child care services, public health. Can you tell us? 
>> So it would be workforce training. It could be child care. Right now we're running a pilot to subsidize, um, child care for those who fall into the benefits cliff. And we're able to leverage, um, general fund dollars in order to do that. Similar. And we've and we braided some of those dollars with arpa in the past. It could also be funding our nonprofit 

[12:13:44 PM]

organizations who support us and providing quality training for folks who need training in order to be skilled up for a better paying job. So, you know, it is it's almost like whack a mole, if I can use that term. I know that's not a professional term, but it's almost like whack a mole, you know, in the old you pay people to steal from Peter, to pay Paul or whatever the terminology is. Um, but we would defund a lot of supportive services for our residents and making those decisions in order to figure out how we move forward. 
>> I thank you for your testimony and again for the work that you're doing. Here's the bottom line. These cuts aren't just line items on a budget seat sheet. They are lifelines. Um, they represent families who have fallen on hard times, families who will now have to wait longer for help on their snap application. Families will get caught in red tape because there aren't enough caseworkers to process their paperwork, and families who will lose out on services because counties have to shift 

[12:14:44 PM]

dollars away from things like workforce training or public health. At the end of the day, these cuts don't make snap more efficient. They just make it harder for families in Ohio to put food on the table. And with that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back. 
>> Thank you. Uh, before we adjourn today, uh, now, uh, like to invite the ranking member to share any closing comments that she may have. 
>> Thank you. And I want to thank our witnesses for being here today and for highlighting challenges that state agencies and counties face when administering snap and informing our committee about the importance of state options, which provide agencies with the flexibility, the flexibility to tailor their services to meet the needs of their communities best. More needs to be done to support families, children, veterans and other vulnerable populations in our communities. It is even more apparent today that the recent cuts to snap in the one big beautiful bill act 

[12:15:45 PM]

will create more problems than they solve. 4 million Americans will lose some or all of their snap assistance as a direct result of the one big, beautiful bill. So much here today was discussed about error rates. I wish we had taken time to really talk about the 80 to 90% success rates that most states have experienced over the last decade, based on cbo estimates, the center for the center for budget and policy priorities estimated that about 1 million children will see food assistance to their families, cut substantially, or terminate it under expanded work requirements. Elimination of eligibility for many lawfully present immigrants and other benefit cuts. States and counties will be forced to raise taxes, cut funding or other social service programs, or possibly stop participating in the program at all. Miss Schmidt, you said you'll have to have some local conversations. That translates 

[12:16:46 PM]

to locally. People will have to figure out how to pay for these services. There is no other way around it. States will be left to make hard decisions, even ending snap altogether because of the legislation passed by this congress, the increased administrative cost share and benefit cost shifts will make it more difficult for states to implement options that streamline application processes and improve customer services. These are real people in my district, in every congressional district across the country, who will be left with fewer resources to make ends meet. I'm talking about our veterans, our seniors, our parents, those working two jobs to put food on the table or those who just need a little bit of help, supplemental help. They were left behind in the one big, beautiful bill. What remains are the problems like benefit cliffs and snap skimming. And no solutions to these problems was included in this legislation. But I remain 

[12:17:46 PM]

committed to improving snap for the 42 million Americans who simply need a little help putting food on their table. And in case it needs to be said, I spent my career as a classroom teacher. If a child, a 15 year old child, let's say 15, I chose that age intentionally came to my class and they were hungry. Their documentation doesn't matter. Do I have a problem with my taxpayer dollars being spent to feed a child in case it needs to be said, the answer is no, and I will fight to make sure that every child in this country, no matter their status, goes to bed with a full stomach. We have the ability to do it. Hunger is a policy choice, and we have demonstrated that over and over and over again. The permanent tax cuts that were given to the wealthiest individuals in this country could have fed countless 

[12:18:46 PM]

families in our nation. I'm still here. I'm ready to work on these issues. I'm ready to find solutions. I'm ready to ensure that we are lowering food insecurity and childhood hunger, and I am at the table and remain committed to doing these things all day, every day, over and over and over again. But when legislation is crafted that talks about the 8% of individuals who are considered able bodied, or the handful of people who have defrauded the system and refuses to acknowledge the success of the snap program in addressing hunger in this country and making sure that people are healthy and can show up in their communities, at work and at school and and just thrive and be productive. Something that we have the ability to assist in. I can't participate 

[12:19:47 PM]

in that. So again, thank you for our witnesses for coming. I've been waiting nine months for you, but happy that you're here. And please reach out to my office if there's anything that we can do to help, just come up with ways to craft legislation to begin to address some of the things that you spoke about here today. Thank you. And with that, I yield back. 
>> Thank you. Thank you to all the witnesses for being here today. This has been an important discussion about how to move forward and meet the intentions of H.R. One's historic reforms. I also want to remind everyone that federal spending on snap has increased by over 70% since. Since 2019, while food insecurity rates have remained stagnant, the status quo isn't working. Republicans are committed to addressing the root problems struggling Americans face, which is why we want to refocus on work and ensure work requirements are robust. After the passage of passage of H.R. One, we have the opportunity to serve folks on this program better, to remove some burdens 

[12:20:47 PM]

from the taxpayers and get people off, snap into into independent futures. I want to again, thank you all for being here and your testimony today. Um, moving on here. Under the rules of the committee, the record of today's hearing will remain open for ten calendar days to receive additional material and supplementary written responses from the witnesses to any questions posed by a member. This hearing of the subcommittee on nutrition and foreign agriculture is now adjourned.

Congressional Committees
The United States has operated the land-based Minuteman III
intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) system for over 50 years, well
past the original intended service life of 10 years. The system includes
more than 600 facilities, including 450 missile silos, across five states.
Our prior work has found the replacement system, Sentinel, faces critical
cost overruns and significant schedule delays.1 The Department of
Defense (DOD) estimates the Sentinel program will cost more than $140
billion and be delayed by years. According to the Air Force, the service
must continue to operate and maintain the aging Minuteman III system
over the next decade and beyond to meet strategic deterrent
requirements until Sentinel is fully fielded.2
The commanding general of Air Force Global Strike Command
overseeing the transition testified before Congress in April 2023 that the
transition “will be one of the major work projects our nation has
undertaken probably in the last 50 plus years.”3 Air Force Global Strike
Command officials told us that the transition is a very complex project that
involves operating two weapon systems simultaneously while executing a
massive military movement to convert the old system to the new system.
The commander of U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) testified
before the Senate Armed Services Committee in February 2024 that

“Sentinel constitutes an incredibly complex megaproject to replace every
facet of the Minuteman III weapon system.”4
Senate Report 118-58, accompanying a bill for the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024, included a provision for us to
review the Air Force’s planning for the transition from Minuteman III to
Sentinel.5 We reviewed the extent to which the Air Force has (1) planned
for the transition and concurrent operation of Minuteman III to Sentinel,
(2) developed plans to prepare operators, maintainers, and security
forces for the transition, and (3) developed plans to meet strategic
deterrent requirements during the transition.
This report is a public version of a classified report that we issued on April
30, 2025.6 DOD deemed some information on plans and capabilities, the
Sentinel test facility, and strategic deterrent requirements to be sensitive
or classified. As a result, this public report omits information that DOD
identified as sensitive or classified. Although the information provided in
this report is more limited, the report addresses the same objectives as
the classified report and uses the same methodology.
For objectives one and two, we collected and analyzed relevant Air Force
transition planning documents, including the Sentinel Transition and
Deployment Strategy Phase II (Phase II), as well as programming plans.7
We interviewed cognizant officials to understand the extent of the Air
Force’s planning for the transition. We interviewed officials at
Headquarters Air Force, Air Force Global Strike Command, and at the Air
Force Nuclear Weapons Center.8 We also visited F. E. Warren Air Force

Base in Wyoming, the first base to transition to Sentinel, and interviewed
20th Air Force and 90th Missile Wing officials. We compared the Air
Force’s planning efforts with leading practices contained in A Guide to the
Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK® Guide) and GAO’s
Schedule Assessment Guide: Best Practices for Project Schedules.9 We
compared the Air Force’s plans to prepare military forces for the transition
against GAO’s Key Principles for Effective Strategic Workforce
Planning.10
For objective three, we met with officials at USSTRATCOM to understand
the strategic deterrent requirements for the ICBM force, any risk to
meeting these requirements during the transition, and any options they
are considering to mitigate potential risk. We met with officials at Air
Force Global Strike Command and reviewed the Air Force’s plans to meet
strategic deterrent requirements during the transition and manage any
risks resulting from the delays to Sentinel. We compared the Air Force’s
plans to meet strategic deterrent requirements during the transition
against project risk management leading practices.11 We also determined
that the risk assessment component of internal control was relevant to
this objective, along with the underlying principle that management should
identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving the defined
objectives.12 To understand the risks to meeting strategic deterrent
requirements during the transition stemming specifically from Minuteman
III sustainment, we met with the Minuteman III Program Office at the Air
Force Nuclear Weapons Center.
We also interviewed officials with the DOD Office of Inspector General
(OIG) who recently evaluated the Air Force’s actions to sustain the

Minuteman III ICBM, and we reviewed the DOD OIG’s final report.13 To
better understand options DOD may be considering to mitigate risks to
meeting strategic deterrent requirements during the transition, we
interviewed officials at the offices of the Under Secretary of Defense for
Policy; the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment;
the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness; the Deputy
Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear Matters; the Joint Chiefs of
Staff; and the Director, Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. See
appendix II for a complete list of offices we met with during our review.
The performance audit upon which this report is based was conducted
from September 2023 to April 2025 in accordance with generally
accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to
provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our
audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a
reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit
objectives. We subsequently worked with DOD from May 2025 to August
2025 to prepare this unclassified version of the original classified report
for public release. This public version was also prepared in accordance
with these standards.
Background
Strategic Nuclear The U.S. strategic nuclear deterrent consists of a triad of ICBMs,
Deterrence Concepts and submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and nuclear-capable bomber
aircraft. Minuteman III is a strategic ICBM weapon system that represents
Key Organizations
the land leg of the nation’s nuclear triad. First deployed in 1970 with a
planned service life of 10 years, the Minuteman III weapon system
consists of missiles as well as 450 launch facilities and 45 launch control
centers. The Air Force extended the Minuteman III service life since its
deployment by various service-life extension programs. The weapon
system can deliver one to three nuclear warheads at intercontinental
ranges.

Minuteman III missiles are dispersed in hardened silos, known as launch
facilities, to protect against attack.14 They are connected to underground
launch control centers through a system of hardened cables. A launch
facility is an uncrewed site that houses the missile and all equipment
required to maintain the missile in a launch-ready configuration. These
underground facilities have been considered part of the Minuteman III
weapon system since 2014. Missile alert facilities are crewed compounds
that encompass the launch control center, a launch control equipment
building, and support buildings. Missile alert facilities are crewed by
security personnel, a cook, a facilities manager, and a launch crew. Each
launch control center controls 10 hardened launch facilities and is crewed
by two officers, also known as a two-person alert team, on 24-hour alert.
See figure 1 for components of the Minuteman III weapon system.

Air Force Global Strike Command, hereafter referred to as Global
Strike Command, is responsible for worldwide strategic deterrent
operations and is the lead Air Force organization responsible for the
transition from Minuteman III to Sentinel ICBM. Global Strike Command is
led by a four-star general officer. A provision in the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023 directed Global Strike Command to

establish an office led by a general officer to guide the transition.15 In
2023, responding to this provision, Global Strike Command established
the ICBM Modernization Directorate (A10). Led by a two-star general
officer, Global Strike Command A10 is working to fill positions and
develop the procedures and processes the office will use to carry out its
mission, according to officials.16 This new directorate is responsible for
oversight and coordination of the transition from Minuteman III to
Sentinel. This responsibility does not include acquisition authorities, which
are retained by the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center.
Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center is the nuclear-focused center within
Air Force Materiel Command synchronizing all aspects of nuclear materiel
management on behalf of Air Force Materiel Command and in direct
support of Global Strike Command.17
Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force for Strategic Deterrence and
Nuclear Integration (Headquarters Air Force A10) serves as the Air
Staff lead for nuclear operations policy, strategy, plans, and
requirements.18 This office directs and guides efforts pertaining to all
elements of Air Force nuclear-related capabilities that produce strategic
deterrence effects, including ICBMs. Headquarters Air Force A10 also
coordinates with Office of the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff,
combatant command, military services, and interagency partners on all
matters related to the Air Force nuclear mission.
USSTRATCOM is the U.S. combatant command responsible for the
strategic deterrence and nuclear operations missions. To execute its
nuclear deterrence mission, USSTRATCOM has unique operational
planning requirements for ICBMs.

Sentinel Program In January 2024, the Air Force notified Congress that the Sentinel
Restructuring program breached a statutory unit cost threshold—known as a Nunn-
McCurdy breach, which triggered a statutorily required review process.19
At the time it declared the breach, the Air Force identified cost growth of
37 percent, although current estimates for the program project total cost
as much higher. After a critical breach, like the one Air Force declared for
Sentinel, DOD must assess the program and make a determination
whether to certify the program to continue; a program that is not certified
will be terminated.
In July 2024, DOD certified the Sentinel program to continue, but
rescinded the Sentinel program’s Milestone B approval and directed the
Air Force to revalidate all operational requirements.20 DOD also directed
the Air Force to restructure the program to address root causes of the
critical cost growth and ensure the program has an appropriate
management structure. DOD issued a report of these findings to
Congress.21 Essentially, DOD determined that the root causes of the
Sentinel program’s cost growth were
• an unrealistic delivery schedule,
• ineffective systems engineering and incomplete basic system
design,22 and
• an atrophied ICBM industrial base.
DOD also reported that the Air Force’s organizational construct was
insufficient for a program of the Sentinel ICBM program’s size, cost, and
complexity.
19The Nunn-McCurdy statute, recodified at 10 U.S.C. ch. 325, is a tool for Congress to
use to hold DOD accountable for unit cost growth on major defense acquisition programs.
The threshold for a critical breach is at least 25 percent above the original baseline. 10
U.S.C. § 4374(c)(1) and § 4371(a)(3)(A).
20Milestone B approval is an approval decision allowing major defense acquisition
programs to enter into system development and demonstration, but not production or
deployment. 10 U.S.C. § 4252; 10 U.S.C. § 4172. DOD officials said in July 2024 that the
process to achieve a Milestone B decision for Sentinel could take 18 months.
21DOD, Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, Root
Cause Analysis of the LGM-35A Sentinel Unit Cost Breach (July 8, 2024).
22DOD stated that ineffective systems engineering combined with untested assumptions
had led to an immature technical baseline. Technical baselines are the formally controlled
definitions of the characteristics of a system that enable the underlying design to progress
using a common reference.

To increase oversight, in August 2024 the Air Force established the new
ICBM Systems Directorate, formerly the ICBM Modernization Directorate,
within the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, merging both the Sentinel
Systems Directorate and the Minuteman III Systems Directorate. The
leader of the ICBM Systems Directorate also serves as the Program
Executive Officer (PEO) ICBMs.23 PEO ICBMs is responsible for the life-
cycle management, inception to retirement, of the Minuteman III and
Sentinel acquisition programs, and coordinates with Global Strike
Command A10 to ensure a successful transition from Minuteman III to
Sentinel ICBM.24 The Air Force has also proposed upgrading the
Commander of the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, currently a two-
star position, to a three-star general officer.
Minuteman III Age-Out As we reported in 2019, according to Air Force officials, Minuteman III is
and Attrition experiencing challenges related to aging facilities, aging infrastructure,
and parts obsolescence.25 Diminishing manufacturing sources, materiel
shortages, and obsolescence issues are additional contributing factors
because they cause difficulty in maintaining a credible supply chain for
Minuteman III parts. The timeline for Sentinel is driven in part by the need
to address Minuteman III’s anticipated attrition and age-related failure.
Prior to the current Sentinel restructuring, the Air Force had planned to
sustain Minuteman III through 2030 and gradually draw down the weapon
system before its anticipated retirement in 2036.26 The Air Force is
developing a new timeline to account for delays to Sentinel.
Concurrent Operation of The Air Force plans to continue operating Minuteman III while also

interrupted.27 As part of Sentinel restructuring, the Air Force is
reassessing all aspects of its plan to field Sentinel, including the extent to
which Sentinel will use the existing Minuteman III launch facilities. The Air
Force has yet to finalize the design for Sentinel launch facilities.
ICBM Basing Global Strike Command oversees three Minuteman III ICBM Wings at
F.E. Warren Air Force Base, Wyoming (90th Missile Wing); Malmstrom
Air Force Base, Montana (341st Missile Wing); and Minot Air Force Base,
North Dakota (91st Missile Wing). The Minuteman III Program Office,
Sentinel Program Office, and PEO ICBMs are located at Hill Air Force
Base, Utah. See figure 2.
27Depot maintenance includes inspection, repair, overhaul, or the modification or rebuild
of end items, assemblies, subassemblies, and parts that, among other things, require
extensive industrial facilities, specialized tools and equipment, or uniquely experienced
and trained personnel that are not available in other maintenance activities. The Air Force
performs depot maintenance for ICBMs on site because the missile sites are not mobile.

Missile Wing Organization Global Strike Command executes its responsibility for the three missile
and Personnel wings through its subordinate unit the 20th Air Force, headquartered at
F.E. Warren Air Force Base. The 20th Air Force supervises the three
missile wings, among other duties. Each missile wing contains
subordinate groups organized by function: an Operations Group, a
Maintenance Group, and a Security Forces Group. The 90th and 341st
Missile Wings also contain a Mission Support Group and a Medical
Group. In this report we focus on the three groups of military personnel
with direct responsibility for ICBM operations: operators (missile launch
officers who perform around-the-clock alert in launch control centers);
maintenance personnel (missile maintenance technicians and nuclear
weapons technicians); and security forces (airmen who are armed,
trained, and certified to protect nuclear weapons).

Transition and Deployment Strategy. The Transition and Deployment
Strategy is the classified general plan for the transition from Minuteman III
to Sentinel systems. It provides Global Strike Command senior leadership
and other stakeholders comprehensive information about the
modernization process. This strategy is living guidance that is updated
and published in phases. Global Strike Command issued the original
Transition and Deployment Strategy, referred to as phase I, in November

2020.30 Phase I, among other things, describes expected preliminary
roles and responsibilities for the transition. Global Strike Command
issued the next iteration, referred to as phase II, in June 2023. Phase II
describes responsibilities assigned to Global Strike Command A10,
including continual risk assessment of missions and systems. As of April
2025, Global Strike Command officials stated they plan to develop a third
iteration of the Transition and Deployment Strategy over the next year as
new details emerge from the Sentinel restructuring.
Site Activation Task Force Concept of Operations. Global Strike
Command issued the Site Activation Task Force Concept of Operations in
September 2024. This concept outlines the roles and responsibilities for
Global Strike Command A10 and PEO ICBMs, including how these new
offices will coordinate efforts, an important step in managing complexity.
Research shows that clearly defining roles and responsibilities at the
outset of a megaproject can help lead to a successful outcome.31 For
example, the Site Activation Task Force Concept of Operations explains
that Global Strike Command is tasked with continuously assessing risk to
the missions and systems related to the ICBM weapon systems and
ensuring that risk is resolved in coordination with relevant supporting
organizations, to include PEO ICBMs.
Sentinel concept of operations. Global Strike Command completed the
Sentinel concept of operations in March 2025.32
Programming plans. According to Global Strike Command officials, they
plan to issue four individual programming plans—one for each of the
three missile bases plus Vandenberg Space Force Base. Global Strike
Command officials stated that because each base is unique, they decided
to issue individual programming plans, rather than a combined plan.
Global Strike Command has issued the programming plan for
Vandenberg Space Force Base, and drafted two others, one for F.E.

According to Global Strike Command officials, neither drafted
programming plans have estimated time frames for final signature as they
are on hold until Sentinel has completed its Milestone B decision. The
programming plans capture Global Strike Command’s overall strategy for
the transition, containing detailed annexes covering logistics, operations,
security forces, and other areas directed by Air Force policy.34 According
to Global Strike Command officials, drafting for the programming plan for
Minot Air Force Base was scheduled to begin in March 2025.
Sentinel Delays Require While Global Strike Command has developed several transition planning
Modifications to Transition documents, the Sentinel restructuring has delayed the start of the
transition and will require the command to modify its transition planning
Planning
and update planning documents accordingly. For example, prior to the
Sentinel restructuring, Global Strike Command planned to begin
transitioning Minuteman III missile silos and launch control centers in
fiscal year (FY) 2025. Those plans are currently on hold while DOD
restructures the Sentinel program. As of April 2025, Global Strike
Command officials stated there is no updated schedule.
Air Force Is Taking Actions Despite the delays stemming from the Sentinel restructuring, Global

facilities from an equal distribution across all three missile wings, to a
majority distribution at the 90th Missile Wing at F.E. Warren Air Force
Base.35 In addition, Global Strike Command officials told us in August
2024 that they are preparing to exercise one non-deployed launch facility
near F.E. Warren Air Force Base within a year, which will serve to

35As described above, to comply with treaty requirements, the Air Force maintains 50 non-
deployed (i.e., empty) launch facilities. The 2020 Transition and Deployment Strategy
states that the Air Force will select launch facilities from the pool of 50 empty launch
facilities for transition from Minuteman III configuration to Sentinel. Each empty launch
facility gained at the 90th Missile Wing requires the 91st Missile Wing or the 341st Missile
Wing to install a missile and bring the missile to alert status, thus reducing their number of
empty launch facilities.

the transition. A March 2025 Global Strike Command memorandum
directed the transfer of the non-deployed launch facility from the 90th
Missile Wing to the Site Activation Task Force effective April 3, 2025.36
Sentinel Delays Present The Sentinel-related delays to the start of the transition present an
Opportunity to Enhance opportunity for Global Strike Command to enhance their risk management
practices for the transition moving forward. According to Global Strike
Air Force Transition Risk
Command officials, they actively manage risk using multiple existing
Management
forums—working groups and corporate-level meetings—but we found
they have not developed tools that specifically address risk management
practices for the transition from Minuteman III to Sentinel. These officials
told us the risk management process is spread across nine forums with a
variety of documents produced by each forum to facilitate information
sharing. They also said the transition planning documents identify risks
and risk mitigation plans, but we reviewed these documents and, while
they did identify risk and risk mitigation plans, we did not find evidence
these documents specifically facilitate risk assessment or risk mitigation.
The programming plan for F.E. Warren Air Force Base includes limited
information on some individual project risks and their impact, but the plan
does not include a summary of risks such as a risk register. The 2023
Transition and Deployment Strategy states that Global Strike Command
A10 is to continuously assess risk to missions and systems, and elevate
areas of concern when needed.
Project management leading practices identify a risk management plan,
risk register, and risk report as important elements of project planning
(see fig. 3).37 Specifically, a risk management plan outlines how risk
management activities will be accomplished. Importantly, a risk
management plan outlines a continuous process that monitors a
program’s health. A risk register describes and tracks risks, and records
specific risk mitigation strategies.38 A risk report summarizes information

38Information in a risk register can include the person responsible for managing the risk,
probability, impact, risk score, planned risk responses, and other information used to get a
high-level understanding of individual risks. A risk register can also provide traceability of
program risk and can be a source for lessons learned during or at the end of key program
events.

on project risk to provide decision makers with a consistent method for
managing and communicating risk to make data-driven decisions. Joint
Staff guidance on risk analysis states that decision makers’ judgment and
experience are critically important within risk analysis, because the senior
leader can often provide a distinct and broader perspective or apply
strategic intuition that helps determine the appropriate risk decision.39
Megaprojects are extremely risky ventures, notoriously difficult to
manage, and often fail to achieve their original objectives.40 Moreover,
research has found that planners can better position a megaproject for
success by investing appropriate time at the front end to develop the tools
and processes to identify and manage risks.
Figure 3: Project Risk Management Tools
When we asked about a transition risk management plan, Global Strike
Command officials told us that, as a newly established office, Global
Strike Command A10 is still working to hire personnel and establish
project management processes. Officials emphasized that all transition
planning efforts are currently under review or undergoing changes due to
the Sentinel delays. The officials stated that Global Strike Command will
continue to identify transition risks and develop risk mitigation strategies

as the program matures leading up to the Sentinel Milestone B decision.
In July 2024, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and
Sustainment directed the Air Force to evaluate options to ensure a
transition between Minuteman III and Sentinel that considers risk,
mitigations, and trades across cost, schedule, and performance prior to
receiving Milestone B approval.41 Global Strike Command officials told us
in August 2024 that they are working on this task as the Air Force
restructures the Sentinel program. However, as of September 2024,
Global Strike Command has not identified specific documents, such as a
written risk management plan, risk report, or risk register, to be developed
in the forthcoming risk management planning efforts.
While Sentinel delays have disrupted transition planning, it has also
presented an opportunity for Global Strike Command A10 to incorporate
strong risk management practices as they continue to fill personnel
positions and establish project management processes. As they do so,
Global Strike Command could use this occasion to implement a transition
risk management plan and an accompanying risk register and risk report
for the transition.
Together, the elements of a risk management plan, risk register, and risk
report would establish an organized, methodical way to identify, assess,
and respond to the myriad risks currently identified at multiple working
groups and forums. Developing a risk management plan will provide clear
direction for accomplishing risk management activities, which are the
responsibility of Global Strike Command A10, according to the 2023
Transition and Deployment Strategy. Including a risk register in future
updates to the site-specific programming plans will provide an organized
and efficient process to summarize key individual project risks and
promote accountability for managing each risk. A risk report could
improve the process of communicating risk updates to leadership and
program stakeholders.

Maintainers. The Air Force developed specific guidance for maintenance
personnel—hereafter referred to as “maintainers”—to deactivate launch
facilities and launch control centers. Similar to operators, officials told us
that maintainers will be responsible for either the Minuteman III system or
the Sentinel system. Therefore, Global Strike Command officials estimate
a 10 percent increase in the number of maintainers will be required for the
peak transition year, FY 2029, based on January 2025 staffing estimates.
Security forces. The 2023 Transition and Deployment Strategy states
that security forces manning must maintain persistent, simultaneous
support for both Minuteman III and Sentinel through deployment and
transition. Global Strike Command officials estimate a 5 percent increase
in the number of security forces will be required for the security forces’
peak transition year, FY 2030, based on January 2025 staffing estimates.
Global Strike Command officials told us they are working on a security
forces concept of operations.
42Global Strike Command officials stated that the estimates for additional operators,
maintainers, and security forces for their respective peak transition years are “snapshots
in time” and could be subject to change as the program develops. Additionally, they
emphasized that these estimates are also subject to change following the Sentinel
Milestone B decision.

necessary activities.
DOD is in the midst of a complete re-evaluation of all aspects of the
Sentinel program including the design of the launch facility. Even so,

these steps must be completed as early as feasible in the transition to
Sentinel.
Security Forces Training Global Strike Command officials told us in August 2024 that there are
Dependent on Updated DOD options to conduct security forces training, but in order to prepare each
Policy individual unit, adequate time for training is necessary to complete
multiple steps, and each step could take a year or more to complete.
The 2023 Transition and Deployment Strategy states that timely and
comprehensive training of security forces is of key concern in preparation
for transition and deployment activities, and that it is imperative that
construction projects stay on time in order to support the on time delivery
of Sentinel. GAO’s Schedule Assessment Guide: Best Practices for
Project Schedules states a project should develop a schedule that reflects
all efforts (steps, events, work required, and outcomes) to accomplish the
deliverables described in the program’s work breakdown structure.43
Schedule planning describes the order and timing of the components
needed to produce the program benefits and estimates the amount of
time required to accomplish each one.
Without establishing a detailed, logical, and sequenced schedule for
construction of the test facility that aligns with Sentinel restructuring plans,
the Air Force risks delays to the multistep process to develop revised
policy and instruction that will be needed to train security forces for the
transition.
Sentinel Delays Present As the Air Force reassesses personnel requirements for the transition in

future personnel gaps. According to Global Strike Command officials, the
Planning
transition will require an increase in personnel, to include operators,
maintainers, and security forces, due to concurrent operations,
deactivation, and sustainment of Minuteman III, and the deployment and
sustainment of Sentinel. This increase will require years of lead time to
prepare these personnel; for example, about 6 years are required to fully
train a missile maintainer, according to officials.

Opportunities Exist for More Global Strike Command officials have conducted some strategic
Involvement of Headquarters workforce planning, such as identifying critical skills and competencies
Air Force on Transition needed for the transition, as well as related personnel gaps. To address
Personnel Needs personnel needs during the transition, senior leadership at F.E. Warren
Air Force Base and Global Strike Command told us they are considering
how the Reserve Component might augment active component military
forces during the transition.44 We asked Headquarters Air Force A10
officials about the prospect of using reserve component forces for
temporary workforce needs during the transition. The officials told us that
Global Strike Command has the authority to activate reserve forces
already affiliated with their command for the transition. However, they
said Headquarters Air Force A10 would need to get involved if Global
Strike Command wanted to request reserve forces outside their
command. Headquarters Air Force A10 told us they are not aware of any
Global Strike Command plans to request reserve forces to assist with the
transition.
DOD personnel management policy directs that the military services shall
consider all available sources when determining personnel mix to include
active and reserve military forces.45 GAO’s Key Principles for Effective
Strategic Workforce Planning states that strategic workforce planning
helps an agency to align personnel requirements with its current and
emerging mission and programmatic goals, as well as with developing
long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, and retaining personnel to
achieve programmatic goals.46 Specifically, it emphasizes, among other
principles, (1) top leadership that is clearly and personally involved in
strategic workforce planning can help provide stability as the workforce
plan is being developed and ensure it is thoroughly implemented and
sustained over time, and (2) when developing workforce planning

strategies, the agency should identify existing flexibilities provided under
current authority that they could use more extensively.47
More direct involvement by Headquarters Air Force, including applying
strategic workforce planning principles, could help ensure smooth
implementation and sustainment of workforce planning over time. As
previously stated, according to Headquarters Air Force A10, Reserve
Component augmentation to Global Strike Command for reserve forces
outside of their command would require the involvement of Headquarters
Air Force. A transition workforce assessment of what personnel
flexibilities are available under established authorities and where Global
Strike Command needs the involvement of Headquarters Air Force would
better position the service to assess options to mitigate personnel gaps.
Such an assessment could help ensure missile wings have enough

and security forces.

Transition Planning
Global Strike Command officials said their transition plans are predicated
on Minuteman III meeting the strategic deterrent requirements until
Sentinel is fully operational. This will require balancing the need to
deactivate Minuteman III missiles in silos for conversion to Sentinel with
the need to keep a sufficient number of Minuteman III missiles on alert to
47GAO-04-39 states that agency approaches to strategic workforce planning can vary with
each agency’s particular needs and missions, and that the success of the workforce
planning process can be judged by its results, not by the type of process used.
Nonetheless, existing strategic workforce planning tools and models and our own work
suggest that the key principles identified should be addressed irrespective of the context
in which planning is done.

meet requirements. Missile maintainers perform regular maintenance on
ICBMs, as figure 5 shows.

Starting in 2021 Global Strike Command developed models to better
understand risk during the transition, officials said. The “alert availability”
model includes planning factors to balance Sentinel program delivery and
meet U.S. strategic deterrent requirements, according to officials.

Limited Supply of Parts Is a As noted earlier, parts obsolescence is a continuing and increasing
Risk to Minuteman III concern as the Air Force faces the prospect of prolonged operation of
Sustainment Minuteman III. A limited and diminished supply of parts may affect the Air
Force’s ability to continue Minuteman III flight tests. Global Strike
Command officials told us that flight tests are a critical source of data on
the missile’s reliability and accuracy, especially as the system continues
to age, and must be continued until Sentinel takes over the mission.
Moreover, the tests are an important signal of U.S. resolve to allies and
partners and demonstrate U.S. ability to maintain a strong, credible
nuclear deterrent, according to the Air Force.
According to Global Strike Command officials, prior to the Sentinel delays
announced in 2024, the Air Force was exploring courses of action to
sustain Minuteman III operational test launches past 2030. With delays to
Sentinel, the Air Force will need to flight test Minuteman III through 2045,
according to Minuteman III program office officials.
USSTRATCOM officials told us in April 2024 that the Minuteman III
program conducts multiple operational flight tests per year to provide
confidence in weapon system performance. In March 2020 the Secretary
of Defense granted the Air Force a waiver to conduct fewer flight tests per
year to conserve parts for future tests, USSTRATCOM officials told us.
The Air Force has not developed a plan for continued Minuteman III flight
testing as a result of the Sentinel delay. The Air Force will need sufficient
time to ensure necessary parts and range support to continue testing.
A coordinated ICBM flight test plan would enable the Air Force to
determine the quantity and type of parts the service needs to be able to
test Minuteman III beyond 2030, and therefore to assess the reliability of
the Minuteman III system beyond 2030.

Officials at the Minuteman III program office told us the missile itself is
performing well. They have enough available assets to sustain the
required ICBMs on alert to 2050, but there are sustainment risks.
Specific details on these risks were omitted because DOD deemed this
information classified.
Air Force officials told us that although they are confident that Minuteman
III can be used beyond 2030, even out to 2050, they acknowledged there
are unknowns such as ground electrical subsystems and electronics—for
example, diodes, resistors, and capacitors—which could degrade to
unacceptable levels. We omitted a table detailing specific sustainment
risks that could impact the transition because DOD deemed this
information classified.
The 2023 Transition and Deployment Strategy states that the Air Force
will manage the Minuteman III and Sentinel fleet in such a manner to
meet USSTRATCOM alert requirements, stating that requirements for on-
alert sorties must be maintained through transition to Sentinel. Federal
internal control standards state that management should identify, analyze,
and respond to risks related to achieving the defined objectives.49 As
previously stated, Global Strike Command A10 has not developed a risk
management plan for the transition including risks resulting from
prolonged operation of Minuteman III. A risk management plan is a
leading practice that provides a structured and efficient process for
identifying risks, assessing their effect, and developing ways to reduce or
eliminate risk.
By specifically addressing Minuteman III sustainment risks in its overall
transition risk management plan, the Air Force could increase the
probability that the service will meet strategic deterrent requirements
during the transition as Sentinel is delayed. Developing and updating a
risk report could provide an organized and efficient mechanism to
communicate Minuteman III sustainment risks to key stakeholders,
including the Office of the Secretary of Defense and USSTRATCOM,
during the transition. A risk report could help the Air Force and
USSTRATCOM understand the myriad risks to meeting strategic
deterrent requirements during the transition, take timely action to mitigate
these risks, and address emergent risks.

The transition from Minuteman III to Sentinel involves a complex, total
Conclusions
ICBM weapon system replacement. The Under Secretary of Defense for
Acquisition and Sustainment has cautioned the Air Force not to overlook
or understate this complexity in future decisions. As the start of the
transition is delayed, the Air Force has the opportunity to invest
appropriate time to develop the tools and processes to manage
complexity. While the Air Force has laid a foundation of plans for the
transition, the service could build on this foundation to focus on the
myriad risks involved in this megaproject. A transition risk management
plan, to include a risk report and a risk register in future site-specific
programming plans, could help ensure the success of the transition.
The Air Force faces workforce challenges from the transition, particularly
for maintainers and security forces, according to officials. Moreover, these
forces are already overburdened, and demand on them will increase as
the transition begins. More direct involvement by Headquarters Air Force
to assess options for workforce planning, to include how the Reserve
Component may fill gaps, could help ensure the missile wings have the
workforce they need for the transition.
The Air Force also faces challenges in preparing security forces for the
transition. As part of the efforts the Air Force already has underway, a
detailed schedule for the completion of the Sentinel test facility that is
coordinated with the Sentinel program could help ensure that the
multistep process to revise policy leading to preparation and training of
security forces stays on track.
Finally, the Sentinel restructuring is an opportunity for the Air Force to
assess and respond to key individual and overall project risks to meeting
strategic deterrent requirements during the transition. These risks include
parts for Minuteman III flight testing beyond 2030, Minuteman III
sustainment, and the implications of a potential decision to re-MIRV
ICBMs. Developing an overall transition risk management plan will help
the Air Force manage these types of risks and better position the service
for a successful transition from Minuteman III to Sentinel.
We are making a total of six recommendations to the Air Force.
Recommendations for
Executive Action
The Secretary of the Air Force should develop a transition risk
management plan for the transition from Minuteman III to Sentinel ICBM.
The plan should include a transition risk report and a risk register in future
Programming Plan updates. (Recommendation 1)

## Page 33

The Secretary of the Air Force should establish a detailed, logical, and
sequenced schedule for completion of the Physical Security System Test
Facility that aligns with Sentinel restructuring plans and reflects
scheduling best practices. (Recommendation 2)
The Secretary of the Air Force should complete an assessment of
personnel needs for the transition, including potential Reserve
Component support for the transition. (Recommendation 3)
The Secretary of the Air Force should expeditiously develop a post-2030
Minuteman III operational test launch plan that is aligned with a Sentinel
fielding plan and coordinated with the Department of Energy.
(Recommendation 4)
The Secretary of the Air Force should specifically address Minuteman III
sustainment risks in the overall transition risk management plan.
(Recommendation 5)
The Secretary of the Air Force should specifically address the personnel
and materiel implications of a decision to re-MIRV ICBMs as part of the
overall transition risk management plan. (Recommendation 6)

Congressional Requesters
Medicaid section 1115 demonstrations—which allow states to test and
evaluate new approaches for delivering services under the federal-state
Medicaid program—have become a significant feature of the program.1
Under section 1115 of the Social Security Act, the Secretary of Health
and Human Services may waive certain federal Medicaid requirements
and approve new types of expenditures that would not otherwise be
eligible for federal Medicaid matching funds for experimental, pilot, or
demonstration projects that in the Secretary’s judgment are likely to
promote Medicaid objectives.
The Secretary delegated responsibility for overseeing Medicaid
demonstrations to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),
the agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
that oversees the program. CMS has approved demonstrations for a
variety of purposes. For example, under demonstrations, states have
extended coverage to populations or for services not otherwise eligible for
Medicaid, made payments to providers to incentivize delivery system
improvements, and introduced new requirements for enrollees.
Demonstrations vary in size and scope and can be comprehensive in
nature, affecting multiple aspects of states’ Medicaid programs. As of May
2025, nearly every state had an approved Medicaid section 1115
demonstration.
CMS policy requires that demonstrations be budget neutral to the federal
government; that is, the federal government should spend no more for
Medicaid under a state’s demonstration than it would have spent without
the demonstration.2 Once approved, each demonstration operates under
a negotiated budget neutrality agreement that places a limit on federal

income and medically needy individuals. Medicaid spending totaled $871.7 billion in 2023,
according to estimates from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’s Office of the
Actuary.
2Legislation enacted on July 4, 2025, commonly known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,
prohibits the approval of a demonstration, effective January 1, 2027, unless CMS’s chief
actuary certifies that the demonstration is budget neutral. An Act To provide for

Medicaid spending over the life of the demonstration, generally 5 years.
The spending limit set by CMS is generally based on projections of what
the state’s existing Medicaid program would have cost the federal
government absent the demonstration.
CMS’s budget neutrality policies, including the methods used to set
demonstration spending limits, have significant implications for the level
of federal spending under demonstrations. For example, we have
previously found the base year used and the growth rate that CMS
applies in projecting spending over the life of the demonstration can add
billions to demonstration spending limits.3
Historically, CMS’s budget neutrality policies have not been defined in
statute or regulations and have not always been transparent. As such, the
implications of policy changes are not always clear.4 For example, in
January 2021, CMS implemented a change—first announced in 2016—to
how it sets spending limits when states seek to extend a demonstration.
In September 2022, CMS began implementing additional changes to this
and other budget neutrality policies. CMS issued guidance
communicating those changes and their applicability across
demonstrations in 2018 and 2024, respectively.5 However, there are no
publicly available estimates of the effects of those policy changes on
spending under demonstrations.
You asked us to examine the potential effects on federal spending of
changes CMS has made to its budget neutrality policies. This report
1. describes how spending on Medicaid demonstrations has changed
over time; and
2. examines how changes CMS made to its budget neutrality policies
over the last 5 years could affect federal spending.
To describe changes in Medicaid demonstration spending over time, we

and Expenditure System.6 We analyzed data from all 50 states and the
District of Columbia for fiscal years 2013 through 2023 (the most recent
year of sufficiently complete data at the time of our review), including
demonstration spending and total Medicaid expenditures.7 We analyzed
the federal share of demonstration expenditures nationwide and variation
in expenditures across states.8 We also interviewed CMS officials about
factors that affected demonstration spending over time. To assess the
reliability of the federal expenditure data, we reviewed related
documentation, including the forms used to collect the data and their
instructions, and the steps CMS takes to ensure data reliability. We also
interviewed and obtained written responses from knowledgeable CMS
officials about the data. We determined that these data were sufficiently
reliable for our purposes.
To examine how changes CMS made to its budget neutrality policies over
the last 5 years could affect federal spending, we reviewed CMS policy
changes from 2020 through 2024, including CMS’s guidance to states
that outlined the agency’s changes to its budget neutrality policies. In
addition, we reviewed demonstration approval documents that included
information on the amounts states could spend under the demonstrations.
This included analyzing CMS worksheets documenting their calculations
for setting demonstration spending limits for a nongeneralizable sample of
six selected state demonstrations. Using those worksheets, we compared
approved spending limits to what those limits would have been absent the
policy changes and estimated the federal share of any differences in
6The Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System is a web-based application that state
Medicaid agencies use to enter and report both states’ budgeted expenditures and the
actual quarterly expenditures that occur. States upload the information using electronic
forms, such as the CMS-64 for quarterly expenditures. CMS uses these data to compute
the amount of federal matching funds the agency will provide to the state for program
operations.
7We adjusted the data in two ways. First, when reporting on Medicaid demonstration
spending, we accounted for prior period adjustments submitted by states. These are
adjustments that states report in subsequent quarters to adjust their reported expenditures
for any underreporting, overreporting, or miscategorized spending in prior periods,
including prior years. Second, because the data span a significant period of time, we
converted all amounts to fiscal year 2023 dollars, the last year in our analysis, using the
Gross Domestic Product Price Index. Our analysis included both medical assistance and
administrative expenditures.

expected spending.9 We selected the demonstrations to ensure a mix of
those approved under the 2021 change to CMS’s budget neutrality
policies (Arkansas, New York, and Tennessee) and those approved after
the September 2022 policy changes (Arizona, Massachusetts, and
Washington).
Our analysis was based on the terms and conditions applicable to each
selected demonstration as of July 2024, including any amendments that
affected the states’ budget neutrality agreements. In addition, where
possible, we estimated the effect of the policy changes on demonstration
spending limits beyond our selected state demonstrations using publicly
available information. We also interviewed state Medicaid officials from
the states for the six selected demonstrations and CMS officials about
CMS’s budget neutrality policies and processes for setting demonstration
spending limits. Finally, we reviewed past GAO findings on CMS’s
approval of demonstrations and assessed the policy changes against
CMS’s policy goal that demonstrations be budget neutral to the federal
government. See appendix I for background information about the six
selected demonstrations, including their approval dates and effective
periods.
We conducted this performance audit from February 2024 through
September 2025 in accordance with generally accepted government
auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the
audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable
basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We
believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

9The federal government matches most state Medicaid spending according to the state’s
Federal Medical Assistance Percentage. This percentage is calculated using a statutory
formula based on the state’s per capita income in relation to the national per capita
income. To estimate the federal share of spending, we applied the standard federal
matching rate for each state to the reported total Medicaid spending (i.e., federal and
nonfederal share combined). Our selected demonstrations generally spanned 5 years,
with varying start and end dates, ranging from 2021 to 2030. To simplify our analysis, we
applied the matching rate from a single year (fiscal year 2026), although these rates may
change slightly from year to year. We chose fiscal year 2026 because it was the most
recently published set of rates at the time of our analysis and because it is included within
the approval period of each of the six selected states. Among our selected states, the
federal matching rate in fiscal year 2026 ranges from 50 to 69 percent.

71.5 million individuals as of December 2024.
Medicaid Section 1115 As of May 2025, 48 states and the District of Columbia operated at least
Demonstrations part of their Medicaid programs under demonstrations. As previously
noted, state demonstrations can vary in size and scope, and many
demonstrations are comprehensive in nature, affecting multiple aspects of
states’ Medicaid programs. CMS typically approves demonstrations for an
initial 5-year period that can be extended in 3- to 5-year increments with
CMS approval.10 Some states have operated some or all of their Medicaid
programs under section 1115 demonstrations for decades.
Each demonstration is governed by special terms and conditions that
reflect the agreement reached between CMS and the state, and describe
the authorities granted to the state. For example, the special terms and
conditions may define what demonstration funds can be spent on—
including which populations and services—as well as specify spending
limits. A state can seek to make changes to its demonstration, including
substantive modifications, by submitting a request to amend the
demonstration to CMS for review and approval.
Budget Neutrality and CMS policy requires Medicaid spending under a demonstration be budget

spent without the demonstration.11 CMS requires states to show that their
demonstrations will be budget neutral as part of their application.
Once approved, each demonstration operates under a negotiated budget
neutrality agreement that places a limit on federal Medicaid spending over
the life of the demonstration. This limit is referred to as the demonstration
spending limit. According to CMS policy, the spending limit for a
demonstration is to be based on the projected cost of continuing the
state’s existing Medicaid program without a demonstration. The higher
these projected costs, the higher the spending limit, and the more federal
10According to CMS officials, CMS’s policy as of May 2025 is that demonstration approval
periods may not exceed 5 years. The agency has made exceptions in the past and
approved demonstrations for up to 10 years. For example, in January 2021, CMS
approved Tennessee’s demonstration for a 10-year period.
11As mentioned previously, legislation enacted on July 4, 2025, prohibits the approval of a
demonstration unless CMS’s chief actuary certifies that it will be budget neutral to the
federal government. That provision is effective January 1, 2027. See OBBBA § 71118.

funding states are potentially eligible to receive for the demonstration in
the form of a federal match on their actual expenditures.
Demonstration spending limits are set in different ways. CMS can
approve a per person per month limit that sets a dollar limit for each
Medicaid enrollee included in the demonstration; CMS can set an
aggregate dollar amount for the entire demonstration period regardless of
the level of enrollment; or CMS can use a combination of a per person
limit for some costs and an aggregate limit for others.
In general, CMS calculates demonstration spending limits by establishing
a base year spending amount, which reflects spending for each
population included in the proposed demonstration. To account for
expected cost growth, CMS then applies a trend rate, which can vary by
population, to estimate spending for each year of the demonstration. The
sum of projected spending across the demonstration period serves as the
spending limit.12 The decisions by CMS regarding which costs it allows
states to include in the base year and which trend rates to apply affect the
size of demonstration spending limits. (See fig. 1).
Figure 1: Process for Setting Medicaid Section 1115 Demonstration Spending Limits
12The spending limit may also include any aggregate amounts set under the
demonstration for spending that is not based on enrollment.
Page 6 GAO-25-107445 Medicaid Demonstration Approvals


## Page 12

Note: Figure depicts the process used by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) as of
May 2025. For demonstrations that include multiple populations, steps 1 and 2 are performed for
each population.
To establish the spending limit, states provide CMS with recent data on
their spending for the populations included in the proposed
demonstration, referred to as the base populations. Historically, CMS has
also allowed states to add amounts the state did not actually expend, but
hypothetically could have spent for populations or services otherwise
allowable under Medicaid, referred to in this report as “hypothetical
costs.” By adding these hypothetical costs to the spending limit, the state
is given additional spending authority to provide these services under the
demonstration.13
Changes in Budget CMS’s stated policy has long been that demonstrations are to be budget
Neutrality Policies Over neutral. The agency’s budget neutrality policies, particularly policies for
setting spending limits, have changed over time. When CMS announces
Time
a policy change, the agency generally begins applying it as applications
for new demonstrations or when extensions of existing demonstrations
are submitted. CMS has made a number of changes to its budget
neutrality policies over the last 5 years, one of which the agency began
applying in January 2021 and others the agency began applying in
September 2022.
• Base year spending. Beginning with demonstration extensions
approved in 2021, CMS began requiring that states use recent, actual
spending data when establishing the base year spending amount for
the demonstration extension period.14 Prior to this change, for states
applying to extend their demonstrations, CMS had allowed states to
further trend their historical spending projections forward to serve as
the base year. Then, in September 2022, CMS revised this policy
once more, allowing spending limit calculations to partially reflect
states’ historical spending projections. Specifically, under the 2022
policy, rather than solely using recent, actual spending data, the base
13For example, we found that when approving a state demonstration that expanded
coverage for adults by paying premiums for private insurance, CMS set a spending limit
that was based, in part, on hypothetical costs. Specifically, CMS included costs for
significantly higher payment amounts to providers than what the state would have paid if
the state expanded coverage under the traditional Medicaid program. See GAO, Medicaid
Demonstrations: HHS’s Approval Process for Arkansas’s Medicaid Expansion Waiver
Raises Cost Concerns, GAO-14-689R (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 8, 2014).
14The requirement beginning in January 2021 to use recent cost data to determine the
base year was initially announced to state Medicaid programs in May 2016. It was then
formalized in a 2018 guidance letter to state Medicaid directors. See CMS, SMD #18-009.

## Page 13

year is composed of a weighted average of recent, actual spending
data (80 percent) and states’ historical spending projections (20
percent).
• Trend rates. Prior to September 2022, CMS applied the lower of the
states’ historical spending growth or the President’s Budget trend rate
for each Medicaid population under the demonstration when
calculating spending limits.15 Beginning in September 2022, CMS
began applying the trend rate from the President’s Budget proposal in
all cases (e.g., regardless of whether it was higher or lower than the
state’s historical spending growth for a given population).
• Hypothetical costs. In September 2022, CMS began allowing states
to include new types of hypothetical costs in their demonstrations,
including costs, subject to limits, for services to address enrollees’
health-related social needs (HRSN), such as housing and food
supports.16 In addition, beginning in January 2023, CMS began
treating as hypothetical costs for pre-release services for incarcerated
individuals, such as behavioral health services for individuals in the 90
days preceding their release from incarceration.
CMS initially communicated these changes in its approval letters to states
for individual demonstrations. The agency issued a letter to state
Medicaid directors in August 2024 clarifying their current budget neutrality
policies, including these changes as well as others.17 Additional changes
noted in the letter include the following:
• Allowing states to seek mid-course corrections to budget neutrality
terms, including spending limits, without having to submit an

annually and are based on the expected expenditures by year for each Medicaid
expenditure group, such as low-income children, people with disabilities, and people aged
65 and older.
16According to CMS, HRSN are social and economic needs that individuals experience
that affect their ability to maintain their health and well-being. They put individuals at risk
for worse health outcomes and increased health care use. HRSN refers to individual-level
factors such as financial instability, lack of access to healthy food, lack of access to
affordable and stable housing and utilities, lack of access to health care, and lack of
access to transportation. See: https:// www.cms.gov/priorities/innovation/key-

amendment, which would otherwise be subject to certain
transparency requirements.18
• Changing the extent to which any unused spending authority can be
carried over by a state from one demonstration approval period to the
next. Specifically, in 2022, CMS began allowing states to carry over
unused spending authority from the previous 10 years of a
demonstration, rather than just the previous 5 years, which had been
its policy since 2016. See appendix II for additional information on this
change.
Recently enacted legislation includes a statutory budget neutrality
requirement effective in 2027.19 When that provision of the law goes into
effect, it will prohibit the approval of demonstrations unless CMS’s chief
actuary certifies that they are budget neutral. It is too early to know how
CMS will change its budget neutrality policies as a result of the act.

20States may submit adjustments to their prior reported Medicaid expenditures. For this
analysis, adjustments for prior periods were applied to the year those expenditures
occurred. Expenditures were also adjusted for inflation to 2023 dollars, using the Gross
Domestic Product Price Index. Data for fiscal year 2023 may be incomplete, as states
generally have up to 2 years to adjust their reported expenditures and these data are as of
April 2025.

Figure 2: Federal Expenditures Under Medicaid Section 1115 Demonstrations,
Fiscal Years 2013, 2018, and 2023
Notes: Amounts include medical and administrative expenditures for demonstrations conducted under
section 1115 of the Social Security Act. The number of states with approved demonstrations was 42
in fiscal year 2013, 39 in fiscal year 2018, and 46 in fiscal year 2023. Data are as of April 2025.
Because states generally have up to 2 years to adjust their reported expenditures, expenditures for
fiscal year 2023 may be incomplete. For this analysis, adjustments for prior periods were applied to
the year the expenditures occurred. Expenditures were also adjusted for inflation to 2023 dollars
using the Gross Domestic Product Price Index.
CMS officials cited a number of factors that may have contributed to the
trends in demonstration spending during this time period, when total
Medicaid spending was also increasing. For example:
• States using demonstrations to cover the expansion population—low-
income adults who became newly eligible for Medicaid beginning in
2014—likely contributed to increases in demonstration spending
during this period. States receiving increased federal matching funds
for that population further contributed to that effect.21
21In states that chose to expand their Medicaid programs as authorized by the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act, the federal government provided a federal matching
rate of 100 percent beginning in 2014 to cover spending for the newly eligible adult
population. This increased federal matching rate for the newly eligible population gradually
diminished to 90 percent in 2020. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396d(y).
Page 10 GAO-25-107445 Medicaid Demonstration Approvals


## Page 16

• Temporary increases in federal matching rates during the COVID-19
pandemic likely also contributed to the growth in federal spending for
demonstrations. For example, the federal matching rate was
temporarily increased by 6.2 percentage points beginning January 1,
2020.22
• Yearly fluctuations in demonstration spending, particularly in large
states, could also have had substantial effects on expenditure trends
and may have contributed to slower growth between 2018 and 2023.
For example, when California removed Medicaid managed care from
its demonstration in 2021, it resulted in a significant decrease in
expenditures, according to CMS officials, which contributed to the
slower growth in spending after this time.23
In fiscal year 2023, federal demonstration spending accounted for about
one-third (33 percent) of total federal Medicaid spending, but this
percentage varied widely across states.24 In 10 states, demonstration
spending accounted for over 75 percent of their total federal Medicaid
spending; in five of these states, demonstration spending accounted for
90 percent or more of total federal Medicaid spending.25 (See fig. 3.)
22The Families First Coronavirus Response Act temporarily increased the Federal Medical
Assistance Percentage by 6.2 percentage points for eligible states in response to the
COVID-19 public health emergency, beginning January 1, 2020, and ending December
31, 2023. See Pub. L. No. 116-127, 134 Stat. 178 (2020), as amended by Consolidated
Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328, 136 Stat. 4459 (2022).
23Under a managed care delivery model, states contract with managed care plans to
provide a specific set of covered services in return for a fixed periodic payment per
enrollee—typically per member per month. Managed care is the predominant method for
delivering services in Medicaid.
24This analysis is based on the expenditures states reported in fiscal year 2023. Since
states may submit adjustments to prior reported expenditures, the analysis may include
expenditures reported in fiscal year 2023 that were for prior years and does not include
expenditures for fiscal year 2023 reported in later years.
25The five states whose reported demonstration expenditures accounted for 90 percent or
more of their federal Medicaid expenditures were Arizona (99 percent), Kansas (96
percent), New Jersey (90 percent), Rhode Island (91 percent), and Vermont (96 percent).

expenditures (Iowa and North Dakota).

Notes: For demonstrations conducted under section 1115 of the Social Security Act, beginning with
demonstrations approved in January 2021, CMS policy required that base year spending for
demonstration extensions be determined using a state’s recent, actual spending. Prior to this change,
base year spending could be estimated by continuing to trend a state’s historical spending projections
forward. Estimates were for the full budget neutrality period, which were as follows: April 2022
through March 2027 for New York, and January 2021 through December 2025 for Tennessee. The
federal share of the decrease was estimated using states’ Federal Medical Assistance Percentages
for fiscal year 2026, the most recent set of published rates at the time of the analysis.
The January 2021 base year policy change was consistent with our 2002
recommendation—which we elevated to a matter for congressional
consideration in 2008—that CMS ensure valid methods are used when
determining budget neutrality.27
In contrast, CMS’s subsequent 2022 adjustment to the base year policy—
to use a weighted average of recent, actual spending experienced in the
previous demonstration period (80 percent) and states’ historical
spending projections (20 percent) when extending a demonstration—
increased demonstration spending limits. It increased spending limits by
about $28 billion in the three selected state demonstrations where CMS

Demonstration Waivers: Recent HHS Approvals Continue to Raise Cost and Oversight
Concerns, GAO-08-87 (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 31, 2008). Because our 2002
recommendation had not been addressed, we asked Congress in 2008 to consider
requiring increased fiscal responsibility in the approval of Medicaid demonstrations. As
indicated above, CMS, in 2021, revised its policy to improve its methods for setting
spending limits for determining budget neutrality. Furthermore, as noted previously,
Congress recently passed and the President signed legislation that, effective January 1,
2027, prohibits the approval of a demonstration unless CMS’s chief actuary certifies that it
will be budget neutral to the federal government. See OBBBA § 71118. While the
legislation addresses our matter for congressional consideration, the recommendation to
CMS has not been fully implemented because the agency has not addressed other
concerns with the methods used when determining budget neutrality. We will monitor
CMS’s implementation of the new legislation to see if that addresses the outstanding
concerns.

Notes: For demonstrations conducted under section 1115 of the Social Security Act, beginning with
demonstrations approved in September 2022, CMS policy required that base year spending for
demonstration extensions be determined using a weighted average of recent, actual spending (80
percent) and the state’s historical spending projections (20 percent). Prior to that, CMS policy
required base year spending to be entirely determined using a state’s recent, actual spending.
Estimates were for the full budget neutrality period, which were as follows: October 2022 through
September 2027 in Arizona, October 2022 through December 2027 in Massachusetts, and July 2023
through June 2028 in Washington. The federal share of the increase was estimated using states’
Federal Medical Assistance Percentages for fiscal year 2026, the most recent set of published rates
at the time of the analysis.
CMS officials told us the agency made the 2022 change to its base year
policy to address concerns raised among states that the 2021 policy
change limited the states’ ability to test coverage of new services or
populations. In interviews with selected states, officials from one state
subject to the 2021 policy said that it did not affect the scope of the
demonstration, whereas officials from another state indicated that the
state scaled back their demonstration as a result of the 2021 policy.
However, moving away from estimates that are fully based on recent,
actual spending diminishes the validity of those estimates and increases
demonstration spending limits and potentially federal spending. Moreover,
the change appears to conflict with concerns CMS raised in its 2018
guidance about using outdated data when calculating demonstration
spending limits, and does not ensure that demonstrations are budget

Assistance Percentages for fiscal year 2026, the most recent set of published rates at the time of the
analysis.
In all three selected demonstrations approved since CMS changed its
trend rate policy, the President’s Budget trend rate was higher than
historical spending growth for one or more of the populations in the
demonstration. For example, in Massachusetts’s demonstration, the
historical spending growth for the largest population group was less than
1 percent, but CMS applied the President’s Budget trend rate of 4.8
percent. This difference accounted for a $3.4 billion increase in the
demonstration spending limit; the estimated federal share of which is $1.7
billion.
Though approved prior to September 2022, CMS similarly applied the
President’s Budget trend rate in all cases to another selected state
demonstration—Tennessee’s—despite the state experiencing a lower
level of growth during the state’s previous demonstration for all but one
covered population.29 This exception to the policy to use the lower rate
increased Tennessee’s spending limit by $1.7 billion ($1.1 billion
estimated federal share). Tennessee officials we spoke with explained
that they asked CMS for an exception to the official policy at the time,
which CMS granted. CMS officials confirmed granting the exception, and
did not cite a rationale other than the state having requested it. The
exception was not noted in the demonstration approval letter.
CMS’s change to its trend rate policy would have had a similar effect in
another selected state demonstration approved prior to the policy change.
New York’s demonstration was approved prior to September 2022, and
having not received an exception, was subject to the previous policy of
trending base year spending using the lesser of the state’s historical
spending growth during the preceding demonstration years or the trend
rates used in the President’s Budget proposal. Applying the President’s
Budget trend rate in all cases would have increased New York’s 5-year
spending limit by about $7.8 billion ($3.9 billion estimated federal share).
In the agency’s 2024 guidance, CMS indicated that the rationale for the
change in trend rate policy was to align its approach to budget neutrality
with federal budgeting principles.30 According to CMS officials, requiring
demonstration spending estimates to be trended using the same rates as
29Tennessee’s demonstration was approved January 8, 2021.
30See CMS, SMD #24-003, 6.

## Page 23

the President’s Budget ensures that the estimates are based on the same
assumptions about future medical care costs and program demographics.
However, it is unclear why the change was needed other than to provide
more flexibility to states. CMS’s September 2022 change to its trend rate
policy adds billions in potential federal spending and does not ensure that
demonstrations are budget neutral to the federal government. As with the
2022 change to the base year policy, the trend rate policy is inconsistent
with our prior recommendation that CMS ensure valid methods are used
when determining budget neutrality.

the federal government.
31See CMS, SMD #24-003. In addition to expenditures for certain HRSN and pre-release
services, CMS has treated other costs as hypothetical that appear not to be otherwise
coverable under Medicaid authorities. For example, in two of our selected state
demonstrations (Massachusetts and Washington) CMS approved, and treated as
hypothetical, costs for services provided in institutions for mental diseases, including for
the treatment of patients with serious mental illness. This increased spending limits in
those demonstrations by over $650 million. These expenditures were treated as
hypothetical even though states likely could not have provided these services absent the
demonstration because Medicaid generally excludes coverage of services to residents of
institutions for mental diseases—which are certain facilities larger than 16 beds that
primarily provide diagnosis, treatment, or other services to persons with behavioral health
conditions. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396d(a)(B), (i). Exceptions include services provided to
inpatients age 65 and older and a state option to cover up to 30 days of services for adults
with at least one substance use disorder at an eligible institution. See 42 U.S.C.
§§ 1396d(a)(14), 1396n(l).

Notes: Analysis shows, for selected state demonstrations conducted under section 1115 of the Social
Security Act, the amounts that spending limits increased due to CMS treating expenditures for health-
related social needs (HRSN) as hypothetical costs. Increases reflect estimated expenditures for both
HRSN services and HRSN infrastructure. Estimates were for the full budget neutrality period, which
were as follows: October 2022 through September 2027 in Arizona; January 2022 through December
2026 in Arkansas; October 2022 through December 2027 in Massachusetts; April 2022 through
March 2027 in New York; and July 2023 through June 2028 in Washington. The federal share of the
increase was estimated using states’ Federal Medical Assistance Percentages for fiscal year 2026,
the most recent set of published rates at the time of the analysis.
CMS’s treatment of certain HRSN costs as hypothetical is a departure
from CMS’s previous practices. Historically, CMS has treated costs as
hypothetical when assessing budget neutrality only if those costs could
have otherwise been covered, absent the demonstration, under existing
Medicaid authorities.32 Costs that could not otherwise be covered under
other Medicaid authorities were not treated as hypothetical. Instead, CMS
only allowed them to be included in the demonstration if the state
identified offsetting savings elsewhere within the demonstration to ensure
the demonstration remained budget neutral. For example, the state would
need to spend sufficiently less under the demonstration than it would
have without the demonstration to offset the additional spending for costs
32For example, costs for populations or services that could have been covered under the
Medicaid state plan or under another Title XIX authority, such as a section 1915(c) waiver,
which can be used to cover home- and community-based services for eligible populations.

that were not otherwise eligible for federal matching funds. This was
CMS’s policy as recently as 2021.33
In our selected state demonstrations, CMS approved costs that it treated
as hypothetical for a range of HRSN services, some of which appear not
to be covered under existing Medicaid authorities.
• Rent or temporary housing for up to 6 months. CMS approved,
and treated as hypothetical, the costs of covering up to 6 months of
rent or temporary housing for eligible individuals in the demonstrations
we reviewed in Arizona, Massachusetts, New York, and
Washington.34 In three of these demonstrations, approved coverage
also included utility costs, including activation expenses and back
payments to secure utilities for individuals receiving rent or temporary
housing. According to CMS guidance, federal matching funds are
generally not available to state Medicaid programs for room costs,
which CMS defines to include all property-related costs, including
rental costs and utilities.35
• Up to three meals per day delivered to the home or private
residence for up to 6 months. CMS approved, and treated as
hypothetical, these costs in the demonstrations we reviewed from
Massachusetts, New York, and Washington.36 While some Medicaid
authorities provide coverage for certain populations for up to two
meals a day, federal matching funds are generally not available for
board, which CMS defines as three meals a day.37
33See CMS, Re: Opportunities in Medicaid and CHIP to Address Social Determinants of
Health (SDOH), SHO #21-001 (Baltimore, Md.: Jan. 7, 2021).
34Under the selected state demonstrations, these services were targeted, for example, to
individuals transitioning out of institutional care or congregate settings (such as nursing
facilities or correctional facilities) and individuals who are homeless.
35See CMS, SHO #21-001. Exceptions include for certain respite care facilities. Section
4442.3(B)(12) of CMS’s State Medicaid Manual defines “room” as hotel or shelter type
expenses, including all property-related costs (e.g., rental or purchase of real estate and
furnishings, maintenance, utilities, and related administrative services).
36Under the selected state demonstrations, populations eligible for these services
included, for example, individuals with chronic conditions, such as diabetes or cancer;
pregnant individuals; and individuals with substance use disorders.
37Exceptions include for certain respite care, personal caregiver, and adult day health care
services. Section 4442.3(B)(12) of CMS’s State Medicaid Manual defines “board” to mean
three meals a day or any other full nutritional regimen.
Page 20 GAO-25-107445 Medicaid Demonstration Approvals


## Page 26

• One-time transition costs, such as first month’s rent. CMS
approved, and treated as hypothetical, one-time transition costs in the
demonstrations we reviewed in Arkansas, Massachusetts, New York,
and Washington. Such costs may be allowable under certain existing
Medicaid authorities for specific populations–typically Medicaid
enrollees transitioning from institutional to community-based
settings.38 However, the populations approved to receive these
services in the selected demonstrations are broader. For example,
populations eligible for one-time transition costs in Arkansas’s
demonstration include individuals with high-risk pregnancies, serious
mental illness or substance use disorder living in rural areas, and
young adults most at risk of long-term poverty. In Washington’s
demonstration, these services were approved for individuals who are
homeless or at risk of homelessness, youth transitioning out of the
child welfare system, and individuals transitioning out of institutional
care or congregate settings.
CMS’s current budget neutrality policy acknowledges that some HRSN
costs could not otherwise be covered under Medicaid absent the
demonstration. CMS’s rationale for treating these costs as hypothetical,
despite not meeting the agency’s previous criteria, is that there are
insufficient or inconsistent data to calculate the cost of providing these
services absent the demonstration.39 CMS guidance also states that
treating HRSN costs as hypothetical gives states more flexibility to test
these interventions, which the agency anticipates could reduce future
Medicaid program costs.40 Noting the potential negative fiscal impact that
treating HRSN spending as hypothetical costs could have on Medicaid,
CMS set a limit for states’ HRSN costs at 3 percent of a state’s total
Medicaid spending.
38For example, section 1915(k) of the Social Security Act allows states to cover certain
home- and community-based attendant services, which may include expenditures for
transition costs, such as first month’s rent. Eligibility, however, is limited to individuals who
in the absence of home- and community-based services would require an institutional
level of care and whose income does not exceed 150 percent of poverty level, or if
greater, are eligible for nursing facilities services under the state plan. See 42 U.S.C.
§ 1396n(k)(1)(D)(i).

Beyond the selected demonstrations we reviewed, as of March 2025,
CMS had approved demonstrations covering HRSN, and treated these as
hypothetical costs, in 13 additional states. Including these costs increased
demonstration spending limits by over $16 billion across these
demonstrations, with the federal share being at least $8 billion.41 (See
app. III for a list of state demonstrations approved to cover HRSN
services.)
It is unclear how many additional states will apply and be approved to
provide HRSN services under demonstrations; in March 2025, CMS
announced that the agency was rescinding two prior policy documents
that discussed opportunities for states to cover services and supports to
address HRSN under various state Medicaid programs, including
demonstrations. The agency indicated that its plan going forward was to
consider states’ applications to cover HRSN services and supports on a
case-by-case basis to determine whether they satisfy federal
requirements for approval under applicable provisions of the Social
Security Act and implementing regulations.42 As of May 2025, CMS
officials said the agency had not issued any changes to its guidance
regarding how costs for HRSN services will be treated for budget
neutrality purposes. However, continuing to include these as hypothetical
costs when calculating demonstration spending limits, rather than
requiring states to offset the costs with savings elsewhere in the
demonstration, does not ensure budget neutrality.43
Pre-Release Services for CMS’s decision to approve, and treat as hypothetical, costs for pre-
Incarcerated Individuals release services for incarcerated individuals also increased
demonstration spending limits. At the time of our analysis, two of our
selected state demonstrations (Massachusetts and Washington) included
approval to provide such services, including medication-assisted
treatment for substance use disorders, physical and behavioral health
consultations, lab and radiology services, and a 30-day supply of

the federal government will pay at least $8 billion. The total federal share is likely higher.
42See CMS, Centers for Medicaid and CHIP Services, Rescission of Guidance on Health-
Related Social Needs, CMCS Informational Bulletin (Baltimore, Md., Mar. 4, 2025).
43We previously reported examples of CMS allowing certain hypothetical costs in
spending limits for selected demonstrations that inflated demonstration spending limits.
See, for example, GAO-02-817. CMS’s current policy adds a new level of concern by
expanding the allowance of hypothetical costs to those for services that could not be
covered under other Medicaid authorities.

prescription and over-the-counter medications provided upon release.44
Treating these as hypothetical costs increased spending limits for these
demonstrations by about $814 million, or an estimated $407 million in
federal spending. According to CMS officials, as of March 2025, the
agency approved demonstrations in 17 additional states to provide pre-
release services for soon-to-be-former inmates of public institutions.45
As with HRSN services, pre-release services do not appear to be
coverable under other Medicaid authorities. Federal law generally
excludes coverage of services to Medicaid enrollees while they are
inmates of a public institution (sometimes referred to as the inmate
payment exclusion).46 In 2023, CMS issued guidance to states on
opportunities to design demonstrations to cover pre-release services as
directed by the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid
Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act.47 However,
neither the guidance nor the act addressed treating these costs as
hypothetical for budget neutrality purposes. CMS’s rationale for treating
these costs as hypothetical, despite them not meeting the agency’s
previous criteria, is that the costs would have been otherwise allowable
under Medicaid were it not for Medicaid’s inmate payment exclusion.
Previously, CMS required that proposed costs for services or populations
not otherwise eligible for federal Medicaid funds (e.g., the costs for pre-
release services for incarcerated individuals) be offset with demonstration
savings for a demonstration to be considered budget neutral. If CMS
44In December 2024, CMS approved Arizona’s request to amend its demonstration to
cover a targeted set of pre-release services for certain incarcerated individuals; however,
the timing of this approval was beyond the scope of our analysis.
45We were not able to develop an estimate of how much spending limits would increase in
these states because states calculate the costs of providing these services on a per capita
basis and we did not have information on the number of individuals projected to receive
these services. CMS officials said they had not developed national estimates for these
amounts.
46Public institutions include facilities such as prisons or jails. CMS regulations generally
define “an inmate of a public institution” as an individual living in an institution that is the
responsibility of a governmental unit or over which a governmental unit exercises
administrative control, with certain exceptions. 42 C.F.R. § 435.1010 (2024). Inpatient
services provided to Medicaid-eligible inmates who are admitted to hospitals or other
qualifying facilities for at least 24 hours are eligible for federal Medicaid funds.

Community Reentry and Improve Care Transitions for Individuals Who Are Incarcerated,

continues to treat the costs of pre-release services as hypothetical, it
cannot ensure that demonstrations are budget neutral.
Section 1115 demonstrations provide a vehicle for states to test new
Conclusions
approaches in their Medicaid programs. CMS’s longstanding policy that
demonstrations be budget neutral to the federal government should serve
as a fiscal control to balance the flexibility granted to states. However, we
have raised concerns over the past three decades about the weaknesses
in CMS’s efforts to ensure that all demonstrations are budget neutral. In
just the last decade, federal spending for demonstrations has nearly
doubled and now represents about a third of total federal Medicaid
spending.
The policy changes CMS announced in 2016—including the 2021
requirement to use recent, actual spending data when setting the
demonstration base year—was a step forward in better ensuring that
demonstrations are budget neutral. In contrast, the more recent 2022
policy changes related to demonstration base years and trend rates have
partially undone that progress. Those changes are likely to increase
federal spending by billions of dollars compared to previous policy and
call into question the agency’s commitment to limiting federal fiscal
exposure resulting from states’ use of demonstrations. Because of the
risks these changes present and the uncertainty around how the new
statutory requirements—not effective until 2027— will affect CMS’s
policies, we reiterate the need for CMS to fully implement our 2002
recommendation to use valid methods when determining budget
neutrality.
Potentially more concerning than the 2022 changes to its base year and
trend rate policies is CMS’s expansion of the types of costs it treats as
hypothetical to those not otherwise coverable under Medicaid, which by
definition could not have been made absent the demonstration. By
treating HRSN services—for example, up to 6 months of rental
assistance—and pre-release services for incarcerated individuals as
hypothetical costs without requiring offsetting savings, CMS has rendered
the assessment of budget neutrality a hollow exercise. Without changes,
this erosion of fiscal guardrails will continue to allow for increased federal
spending under demonstrations.
The Administrator of CMS should revise the agency’s section 1115

that could not have otherwise been covered under existing Medicaid

Instead, CMS should require the costs of those populations or services to
be offset by other reductions in demonstration spending.

2022 Policy on the Availability of Unused
Demonstration Spending Authority
September 2022 Policy on the Availability of
Unused Demonstration Spending Authority
In September 2022, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
changed its policies for ensuring that Medicaid section 1115
demonstrations are budget neutral to the federal government. Unused
demonstration spending authority may result when a state spends less
than its demonstration spending limit. One of the policy changes CMS
made was to increase the time period of unused spending authority that
states can carry over from one demonstration period to another.
Specifically, CMS began allowing states to carry over unused spending
authority from the previous 10 years, rather than the previous 5 years as
had been its policy since 2016. However, CMS also placed a cap, or
overall limit, on the amount of unused spending authority states may use.
Specifically, the total unused spending authority a state may access in its
current demonstration, which includes any unused spending authority
carried over from prior demonstration periods, may not exceed 15 percent
of the state’s projected total Medicaid expenditures for the demonstration
period. Additionally, under CMS’s September 2022 policy, states are
required to use their unused spending authority in the order it was
accrued. Figure 4 illustrates the comparison CMS makes between the
total unused spending authority potentially available and the new 15
percent cap.

Section 1115 Demonstration Spending Authority
Notes: For demonstrations conducted under section 1115 of the Social Security Act, beginning with
demonstrations approved in September 2022, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
policy allowed states to carry over up to 10 years of unused spending authority from one
demonstration period to the next, subject to a cap equal to 15 percent of a state’s Medicaid spending.
(Since 2016, CMS policy had been to allow five such years of “carry over.”) Total unused
demonstration spending is defined as the sum of any unused demonstration spending authority from
a state’s current demonstration plus any carry over from the previous 10 years. The 15 percent cap is
based on CMS estimate of a state’s total Medicaid expenditures during the demonstration period,
including for expenditures outside of the demonstration. The lesser of these two amounts represents
the unused spending authority available under the current demonstration.
In August 2024, CMS formalized its September 2022 policy changes in a
State Medicaid Director Letter.1 The letter included an additional policy
change that interacts with CMS’s policy on demonstration carry over.
Specifically, the letter indicated that any unused spending authority above
the 15 percent cap is not immediately forfeited; rather, it may be deferred

to the subsequent demonstration period or transferred to another one of
the state’s demonstrations (if the state has more than one).2
The revised carry over policy and 15 percent cap were applicable to three
of the selected state demonstrations we reviewed. The cap significantly
reduced the amount of unused spending authority two states could use in
their current demonstration periods (Arizona and Massachusetts) and had
no effect on the third demonstration (Washington). However, the net
effect of the changes on federal spending for demonstrations in Arizona
and Massachusetts will depend on whether those states seek to leverage
any unused spending authority above the cap in future demonstration
periods or for other demonstrations. The amounts of unused spending
authority above the cap totaled $38.6 billion for the Arizona demonstration
and $27.0 billion for the Massachusetts demonstration. (See table 6.)

As of March 2025, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)
had approved 18 states to cover services addressing beneficiaries’
health-related social needs (HRSN) through 19 Medicaid section 1115
demonstrations. (See table 7.) According to CMS, HRSN are social and
economic needs that individuals experience that affect their ability to
maintain their health and well-being.1 CMS has approved states to
provide a range of HRSN services under Medicaid demonstrations, such
as various housing and nutrition supports. In each demonstration, HRSN
costs were added as hypothetical costs to states’ demonstration spending
limits for the purposes of determining budget neutrality.

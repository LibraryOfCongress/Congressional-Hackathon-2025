Chief Information Officer Open Recommendations: Department of Transportation
Dear Mr. Pidugu:
I am writing to you with respect to your role as the Chief Information Officer (CIO) for the
Department of Transportation (DOT). As an independent, non-partisan agency that works for
Congress, GAO’s mission is to support Congress in meeting its constitutional
responsibilities and help improve the performance and ensure the accountability of the
federal government. Our work includes investigating matters related to the use of public funds
and evaluating programs and activities of the U.S. Government at the request of congressional
committees and subcommittees, on the initiative of the Comptroller General, and as required by
public laws or committee reports. Our duties include reporting our findings and recommending
ways to increase economy and efficiency in government spending. The purpose of this letter is
to provide an overview of the open GAO recommendations to DOT that call for the attention of
the CIO.
We identified recommendations that relate to the CIO’s roles and responsibilities in effectively
managing IT. They include strategic planning, investment management, and information
security. We have previously reported on the significance of the CIO’s role in improving the
government’s performance in IT and related information management functions.1 Your attention
to these recommendations will help ensure the secure and effective use of IT at the department.
Currently, DOT has 34 open recommendations that call for the attention of the CIO, including 14
that are sensitive and 14 that are relevant to a component-level CIO.2 Each of these
recommendations relates to a GAO High-Risk area: (1) Ensuring the Cybersecurity of the
Nation or (2) Improving IT Acquisitions and Management.3 In addition, GAO has designated two

Challenges in Implementing Responsibilities, GAO-18-93 (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 2, 2018).

relevant to the department’s CIO.

of the 34 as priority recommendations.4 Fully implementing these open recommendations could
significantly improve DOT’s ability to deter threats and manage its critical systems, operations,
and information. I have summarized selected recommendations here. See the enclosure for a
full list, and additional details on the GAO recommendations, including the sensitive
recommendations.
Ensuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation. DOT needs to take action to secure the
information systems it uses to carry out its mission. This includes fully developing an
organization-wide cybersecurity risk management strategy and risk assessment. Until DOT
implements this recommendation, the department may lack a clear organization-wide
understanding of acceptable risk levels and appropriate risk response strategies to protect its
systems and data.
In addition, we recommended that the department fully implement all event logging
requirements as directed by the Office of Management and Budget. Until DOT implements this
recommendation, there is increased risk that the department will not have complete information
from logs on its systems to detect, investigate, and remediate cyber threats.
Improving IT Acquisitions and Management. DOT needs to take steps to effectively acquire
and manage IT. For example, we recommended that DOT develop a department-wide
comprehensive policy for the management of software licenses, and analyze license data to
identify opportunities to reduce costs. Until DOT implements this recommendation, the
department cannot determine its most widely used software applications and better inform
investment decision making.
DOT also needs to provide direction and oversight of IT acquisitions for cloud services. This
includes implementing the Office of Management and Budget’s Federal Cloud Computing
Strategy in order to evaluate safe and secure cloud computing options before making new
investments. Until the department implements federal guidance, DOT faces increased risk that
cloud services will not be effectively managed.
In addition to GAO’s recommendations, the DOT Inspector General also has multiple open
recommendations in the areas of cybersecurity and IT acquisitions and management. These
include cybersecurity recommendations that relate to the department’s requirements under the
Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014.5 It will be important to address both
GAO and Inspector General recommendations.
Copies of this letter are being sent to the appropriate congressional committees and the Federal
CIO. The letter will also be available at no charge on the GAO website at https://www.gao.gov.
In addition, we sent a separate letter related to department-wide priority recommendations,
which conveys the importance of addressing cybersecurity risks, to the Secretary of
4Priority recommendations are those that GAO believes warrant priority attention from heads of key departments or
agencies. They are highlighted because, upon implementation, they may significantly improve government
operations, for example, by realizing large dollar savings; eliminating mismanagement, fraud, and abuse; or making
progress toward addressing a high-risk or duplication issue. Since 2015, GAO has sent letters to selected agencies to
highlight the importance of implementing such recommendations.
5The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014, Pub. L. No. 113-283, 128 Stat. 3073 (Dec. 18, 2014)
largely superseded the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, enacted as Title III, E-Government Act
of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-347, 116 Stat. 2899, 2946 (Dec. 17, 2002).

letter, please do not hesitate to contact me at marinosn@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices

for your personal attention to these important recommendations.

Enclosure
Chief Information Officer Open Recommendations to the Department of Transportation
This enclosure includes the open GAO recommendations to the Department of Transportation
(DOT) that call for the attention of its Chief Information Officer (CIO), including the sensitive
recommendations.8 We have divided these recommendations into two categories: (1) ensuring
the cybersecurity of the nation and (2) improving IT acquisitions and management.
Ensuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation
Federal agencies depend on IT systems to carry out operations and process, maintain, and
report essential information. The security of these systems and data is vital to protecting
individual privacy and ensuring national security. Table 1 provides information on the open
cybersecurity-related recommendations relevant to the DOT CIO.

Improving IT Acquisitions and Management
Federal IT investments too frequently fail to deliver capabilities in a timely, cost-effective
manner. Key management challenges—such as a lack of disciplined project planning and
program oversight—continue to hamper effective acquisition and management of the
government’s IT assets. Table 2 provides information on the open IT acquisition and
management-related recommendations relevant to the DOT CIO.

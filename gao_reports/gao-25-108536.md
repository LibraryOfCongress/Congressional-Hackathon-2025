Chief Information Officer Open Recommendations: Department of the Interior
Dear Mr. Mclnerny:
I am writing to you with respect to your role as the Chief Information Officer (CIO) for the
Department of the Interior. As an independent, non-partisan agency that works for Congress,
GAO’s mission is to support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and help
improve the performance and ensure the accountability of the federal government. Our
work includes investigating matters related to the use of public funds and evaluating programs
and activities of the U.S. Government at the request of congressional committees and
subcommittees, on the initiative of the Comptroller General, and as required by public laws or
committee reports. Our duties include reporting our findings and recommending ways to
increase economy and efficiency in government spending. The purpose of this letter is to
provide an overview of the open, publicly available GAO recommendations to Interior that call
for the attention of the CIO.
We identified recommendations that relate to the CIO’s roles and responsibilities in effectively
managing IT. They include strategic planning, investment management, and information
security. We have previously reported on the significance of the CIO’s role in improving the
government’s performance in IT and related information management functions.1 Your attention
to these recommendations will help ensure the secure and effective use of IT at the department.
Currently, Interior has 13 open recommendations that call for the attention of the CIO, including
two that are relevant to component-level CIOs. Each of these recommendations relates to a
GAO High-Risk area: (1) Ensuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation or (2) Improving IT
Acquisitions and Management.2 In addition, GAO has designated one of the 13 as a priority
recommendation.3 Fully implementing these open recommendations could significantly improve
1See for example, GAO, Federal Chief Information Officers: Critical Actions Needed to Address Shortcomings and
Challenges in Implementing Responsibilities, GAO-18-93 (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 2, 2018).
2GAO, High-Risk Series: Heightened Attention Could Save Billions More and Improve Government Efficiency and
Effectiveness, GAO-25-107743 (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 25, 2025).
3Priority recommendations are those that GAO believes warrant priority attention from heads of key departments or
agencies. They are highlighted because, upon implementation, they may significantly improve government
operations, for example, by realizing large dollar savings; eliminating mismanagement, fraud, and abuse; or making
progress toward addressing a high-risk or duplication issue. Since 2015, GAO has sent letters to selected agencies to
highlight the importance of implementing such recommendations.

Interior’s ability to address threats and manage its critical systems, operations, and information.
I have summarized selected recommendations here. See the enclosure for a full list and
additional details on the GAO recommendations.
Ensuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation. Interior needs to make progress in its
cybersecurity incident response preparedness by taking steps to improve its investigation and
remediation capabilities. Specifically, we recommended that the department fully implement all
event logging requirements as directed by the Office of Management and Budget. Until Interior
does so, there is increased risk that the department will not have complete information from logs
on its systems to detect, investigate, and remediate cyber threats.
Improving IT Acquisitions and Management. Interior needs to improve its oversight of IT
investments. For example, we recommended that the department implement leading practices
in executive-level IT governance for major IT investments. Implementing this recommendation
will provide Interior with greater assurance that it will expend funds for future IT investments in
the most cost-effective way and will support, rather than detract from, mission needs.
We also recommended that the department complete annual reviews of its IT portfolio
consistent with federal requirements. Until Interior implements this recommendation, it may miss
opportunities to identify areas of duplication within its IT portfolio and to develop strategies to
streamline operations and optimize resource allocation.
In addition to GAO’s recommendations, the Interior Inspector General also has multiple open
recommendations in the areas of cybersecurity and IT acquisitions and management. These
include recommendations that relate to the department’s requirements under the Federal
Information Security Modernization Act of 2014.4 It will be important to address both GAO and
Inspector General recommendations.
Copies of this letter are being sent to the appropriate congressional committees and the Federal
CIO. The letter will also be available at no charge on the GAO website at https://www.gao.gov.
In addition, we sent a separate letter related to department-wide priority recommendations to
the Secretary of the Interior.5
4The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014, Pub. L. No. 113-283, 128 Stat. 3073 (Dec. 18, 2014)
largely superseded the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, enacted as Title III, E-Government Act
of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-347, 116 Stat. 2899, 2946 (Dec. 17, 2002).

Enclosure
Chief Information Officer Open Recommendations to the Department of the Interior
This enclosure includes the open, publicly available GAO recommendations to the Department
of the Interior that call for the attention of its Chief Information Officer (CIO). We have divided
these recommendations into two categories: (1) ensuring the cybersecurity of the nation and (2)
improving IT acquisitions and management.
Ensuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation
Federal agencies depend on IT systems to carry out operations and process, maintain, and
report essential information. The security of these systems and data is vital to protecting
individual privacy and ensuring national security. Table 1 provides information on the open
cybersecurity-related recommendation relevant to the Interior CIO.

Improving IT Acquisitions and Management
Federal IT investments too frequently fail to deliver capabilities in a timely, cost-effective
manner. Key management challenges—such as a lack of disciplined project planning and
program oversight—continue to hamper effective acquisition and management of the
government’s IT assets. Table 2 provides information on the open IT acquisition and
management-related recommendations relevant to the Interior CIO.

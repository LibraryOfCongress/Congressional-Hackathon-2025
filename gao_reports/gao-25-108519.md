SCIENCE & TECH SPOTLIGHT:
AI AGENTS
GAO-25-108519, September 2025
Figure 1. Properties that Characterize AI Systems as More Agentic
WHY THIS MATTERS
Agents are AI systems that can not only create content but
also operate autonomously to accomplish complex tasks and
make instantaneous decisions in response to changing
conditions. Agents have the potential to reshape the
workplace, with advocates emphasizing that agents could
increase efficiency in areas such as data entry and resource
management. However, policymakers are concerned about
the potential for misuse and unintended consequences, as
well as job displacement resulting from agent implementation.
KEY TAKEAWAYS
» Current AI agents are limited to specific purposes, such
as software development and autonomous vehicles.
» As AI becomes more agentic, it will be able to accomplish
more complex tasks across various fields.
» Policymakers face questions about how to prevent

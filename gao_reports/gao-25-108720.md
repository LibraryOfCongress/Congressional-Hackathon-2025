Chairman Murkowski, Vice Chairman Schatz, and Members of the
Committee:
Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our recent work on the
Department of Energy’s (DOE) tribal energy programs. My testimony
summarizes our August 2025 report, Tribal Energy Finance: Changes to
DOE Loan Program Would Reduce Barriers for Tribes.1 This statement
discusses (1) the status of applications to DOE’s Tribal Energy Financing
Program (TEFP), (2) strengths and limitations of the program, and (3)
ways to improve its design and implementation.
While considerable conventional and renewable energy resources exist
throughout Indian country, tribal communities often face challenges to
developing these resources.2 These include a lack of access to capital
and systemic barriers to accessing federal programs.3 According to DOE,
86 percent of tribal lands with energy potential are undeveloped.
Developing these resources through tribal energy projects could help
address the nation’s energy needs and create economic development
opportunities for some Tribes and their members.4 For example, such
projects can help Tribes lower their energy costs and create access to
reliable energy, improve living conditions, fund government programs and
1GAO, Tribal Energy Finance: Changes to DOE Loan Program Would Reduce Barriers for
Tribes, GAO-25-107441 (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 11, 2025).
2As of August 2025, there were 574 federally recognized Tribes in the contiguous United
States and Alaska. Federally recognized Tribes have a government-to-government
relationship with the United States and are eligible to receive certain protections, services,
and benefits by virtue of their status as Indian Tribes. For the purposes of this statement,
we use the term “Tribes” to refer to any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized
group or community, including any Alaska Native village or regional or village corporation
as defined in or established pursuant to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, which is
recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States
to Indians because of their status as Indians.

surrounding areas.
TEFP, administered by DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO), provides
loans and loan guarantees for tribal energy development.5 The program
supports federally recognized Indian Tribes or tribal energy development
organizations that develop energy resources, products, or services using
commercial technology. TEFP is intended to support a broad range of
energy development projects and activities. It is technology neutral, which
means it offers financing for projects that use various types of energy
technology such as electricity generation, transmission, or distribution
facilities that use conventional or renewable energy sources; energy
resource extraction, refining, or processing facilities; or energy storage
facilities. These projects can be on or off tribal land, and applicants can
include Tribes, tribal energy development organizations, and lenders that
apply on behalf of Tribes.
To conduct this work, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, agency
policies, and guidance documents related to program applications,
design, and implementation. We analyzed TEFP application documents
and LPO data as of February 2025 to describe the status of applications
since 2018.6 We interviewed DOE officials, 12 potential participants (e.g.,
Tribes and lenders) that applied or considered applying to the program,
and five tribal energy stakeholders (e.g., lenders, consultants, and
nongovernment organizations). Our work was performed in accordance
with generally accepted government auditing standards. More detailed
information on the scope and methodology of our work is provided in our
August 2025 report.
5The Energy Policy Act of 2005 created the Tribal Energy Loan Guarantee Program,
which initially only provided loan guarantees. Pub. L. No. 109-58, tit. V, § 503(a), 119 Stat.
594, 764–78 (codified in relevant part as amended at 25 U.S.C. §§ 3501, 3502(c)). The
program was first funded in 2017; see Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2017, Pub. L.
No. 115-31, 131 Stat. 135, 313 (2017). In 2022, it was expanded to allow direct loans.
DOE refers to the expanded program as the Tribal Energy Financing Program.
6In July 2025, DOE officials provided an update on the status of new applications to the
program. We incorporated this information into the report where appropriate.

Of these 20 applications, DOE closed a $100 million loan guarantee in
August 2024 for a solar and long-duration storage microgrid project on
tribal lands of the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay Indians in California.9 As of
February 2025, 12 applications were inactive (i.e., put on hold, withdrawn,
or abandoned). Progress on the remaining seven active applications was
limited by a pause that began in January 2025 as the current
administration reviewed the program.10 In July 2025, Congress rescinded
all unobligated program appropriations provided by the Inflation
Reduction Act (IRA), reducing available funding.11
Many applications spent considerable time in the intake phases of the
application process, and most active and inactive applications (16 of 20)
7In 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) increased TEFP’s loan authority from $2 billion
to $20 billion. An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to Title II of S. Con. Res. 14,
Pub. L. No. 117-169, § 50145(b)(2), 136 Stat. 1818, 2046 (2022) (amending 25 U.S.C. §
3502(c)(4)).
8Our report provides additional information on energy technology type, requested loan
amount, application status, and time spent in each phase of the application process for
each TEFP application LPO has received since 2018.
9A loan or guarantee is closed when LPO and the applicant sign an agreement that
finalizes it, and LPO begins to disburse funds to the applicant for the project. LPO
considers closed loans active because LPO plans to monitor the loan or loan guarantee
over its lifetime. The loan guarantee amount for the Viejas project was the actual obligated
amount, based on data we received from LPO as of February 2025.
10E.O. 14154 of January 20, 2025, Unleashing American Energy, directed agencies to
immediately pause disbursement of funds appropriated under the IRA or the Infrastructure
Investment and Jobs Act, pending a review of such disbursements. 90 Fed. Reg. 8353,
8357 (Jan. 29, 2025).
11Congress in the IRA appropriated $75 million for credit subsidy and to administer the
program. Pub. L. No. 117-169, § 50145(a), 136 Stat.at 2045–46. In July 2025, Congress
rescinded the unobligated balance of TEFP’s IRA appropriations in Public Law 119-21—
commonly known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. An Act To provide for reconciliation
pursuant to title II of H. Con. Res. 14, Pub. L. No. 119-21, tit. V, subtit. D, § 50402(b), 139
Stat. 72, 152. As a result, the program has only pre-IRA appropriations, if any remain
unobligated, of $8.5 million. Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017, Pub. L. No. 115-31,

remained in these phases as of February 2025 (see fig. 1). Time spent in
intake ranged from 41 days to 821 days, as of February 2025. LPO
officials told us that various factors, such as project readiness and the
applicant’s familiarity with the application process, can influence how
quickly an application progresses.
Figure 1: Status of Applications to the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Tribal Energy
Financing Program, as of February 2025
Note: Active applications are project applications undergoing review by DOE and include closed loans
that DOE continues to monitor through the end of the loan term. Inactive applications are those that
were withdrawn, abandoned, or otherwise put on hold. According to DOE officials, as of July 18,
2025, DOE had not received any new applications for the program.
Several aspects of the program’s design create significant financial

barriers for Tribes that can discourage them from participating in the
Restrictions That Can
program, including the following:
Discourage Tribal
• Limited project development assistance. LPO expects
Participation applicants to its programs to have projects that are well defined
and significantly beyond the concept stage, according to LPO
documents and officials. However, many Tribes do not have the
upfront cash resources for early project development activities,
which can be expensive, especially for larger-scale projects. One
applicant told us a Tribe could spend a total of $10 million to $30
million to make a project “shovel ready.”
• Potentially high and unpredictable due diligence fees. DOE
requires tribal applicants to pay fees and expenses for external
legal and expert services (e.g., technical, financial, and
environmental), as needed, that help DOE evaluate projects and
requested financing. However, the level and unpredictability of
these due diligence costs discourages Tribes from applying to
Page 4 GAO-25-108720 Tribal Energy Finance


## Page 8

TEFP, according to potential participants and stakeholders. For
example, one Tribe that decided not to apply to the program said
these costs could translate into millions of dollars. Another tribal
applicant said the contractors DOE uses for TEFP legal work did
not know enough about tribal law and energy projects, resulting in
more hours billed to the Tribe.
Our report provides more detail about these and other challenges.
While LPO has taken some steps to help Tribes with these costs, we
recommended doing more to further reduce the challenges Tribes still
face. Actions LPO has taken include, for example, increased outreach,
allowing project development costs to be included in TEFP loans on a
project-by-project basis, and plans to develop a public finance
“application pathway” that could reduce due diligence for lower-risk
projects and shorten application time frames. However, Tribes often need
immediate assistance and funding for project development activities and
help identifying and accessing them. LPO offers this help on a case-by-
case basis and has compiled an internal list of development grants used
to support larger-scale energy projects. But it is unclear how
comprehensively these options will address Tribes’ needs. DOE also has
not finalized steps it is taking to reduce due diligence costs, such as
details and guidance for the application pathway.
We recommended that DOE (1) identify and disseminate information on
federal funding that could help Tribes develop large-scale energy projects
ready for application and provide Congress information on gaps, and (2)
further develop and implement options to revise the due diligence process
to further reduce or eliminate fees on a project-by-project basis. In its
comments on our report, DOE concurred with these two
recommendations and described steps it plans to take to implement them.
DOE has taken steps to improve its outreach to Tribes about TEFP, but

• Long application time frames. Lengthy application time frames have
resulted in delayed project timelines, higher project costs, and loss of
project partners, according to potential participants. For example, one
tribal applicant said it lost its power purchaser and access to a
multimillion-dollar bridge loan, making its project unviable. Our
analysis of application data found that the median time in intake was
Page 5 GAO-25-108720 Tribal Energy Finance


## Page 9

334 days (see fig. 2). The Viejas project, the only application to
complete the full process, spent almost 2 years (645 days) from
entering intake to closing. LPO officials noted that these timelines may
include extended periods of guidance and preparation to assist
applicants with their applications, as well as the applicant’s turnaround
time to submit additional application support documents.
Figure 2: Loan Request Amount, Status, and Time Spent in the Application Process for Each Application to Department of
Energy’s (DOE) Tribal Energy Financing Program, as of February 2025
Note: The Tribal Energy Financing Program had received 20 applications as of February 2025 and did not receive any new applications between then
and July 18, 2025, according to DOE officials.
• Complex application process. The TEFP application process
involves multiple stages of review and feedback, according to our
review of program documents. LPO officials said they understood that
tribal applicants might see the program as complex, but that to be
successful, applicants must complete significant work upfront with the
aid of legal counsel, engineering firms, and consultants. However, one
Page 6 GAO-25-108720 Tribal Energy Finance


## Page 10

potential participant said that because of this complexity, many Tribes
cannot move through the application process without costly third-party
assistance.
• Unclear program guidance. Tribal applicants we interviewed said
they received different information from different LPO officials about
certain program rules, such as equity requirements or whether TEFP
could cover development costs. For example, one tribal applicant said
they were told the loan could be used for development costs, such as
environmental reviews, site control leases, and legal costs. However,
LPO later told the applicant that such costs were not covered. When
the applicant said it could no longer move forward with the loan
without help with development costs, LPO agreed to include the costs.
We reviewed LPO’s program documents and found that its guidance
was not clear on some TEFP requirements. For example,
requirements varied for loan sizes, equity, technology types, and
outreach and intake.
• Limited tribal experience at DOE. Most LPO staff reviewing TEFP
applications have limited experience in tribal energy finance,
according to our analysis of LPO staffing practices. While LPO
designated 12 of its 274 federal staff to focus primarily on TEFP or to
work for the program on a recurring basis as of May 2025, most of
these positions have not been filled consistently. Significant changes
to LPO’s overall staffing levels and an ongoing government-wide
hiring freeze are also likely to affect the availability of dedicated staff
with expertise to work on tribal applications.12 As of July 18, 2025, 43
of LPO’s 271 authorized positions were vacant, and 110 employees
who had elected to resign on a deferred basis were on administrative
leave until their resignation or retirement date, according to DOE
officials. LPO officials and staff told us that without adequate
experienced staff, LPO could continue to face challenges effectively
processing Tribes’ applications—increasing application review times
and requiring greater use of outside consultants to fill knowledge
gaps. One tribal applicant also told us LPO staff resources were taken
away from its application because LPO said it had inadequate staff for
tribal projects.
12For example, a February 2025 executive order directed agency heads to promptly
undertake preparations to initiate large-scale reductions in force, among other steps. E.O.
14210 of February 11, 2025, Implementing the President’s “Department of Government
Efficiency” Workforce Optimization Initiative, 90 Fed. Reg. 9669 (Feb. 14, 2025). In
addition, a presidential memorandum extended a previously issued hiring freeze for
executive branch agencies through October 15, 2025. Presidential Memorandum,
Ensuring Accountability and Prioritizing Public Safety in Federal Hiring (July 7, 2025).
Page 7 GAO-25-108720 Tribal Energy Finance


## Page 11

LPO has taken some actions to address these barriers, according to LPO
officials, but Tribes continue to face challenges. For example, LPO is
revising its application processes, such as adjusting the rigor of its review
and testing a new public finance application pathway; has identified
timeliness goals; is verbally clarifying misconceptions; and began
providing some staff with specific training on working with Tribes that
addresses topics such as awareness of tribal law and government
procedures. However, LPO officials said they were not yet certain
whether their effort to revise the application process would be effective,
had not developed the necessary documents to guide the effort, and did
not have the staff with the needed expertise in public finance. LPO also
had not documented information to correct misconceptions or updated
internal and external guidance on the application process.
The barriers that still exist have created uncertainties for potential
participants and lengthened application time frames, which may make it
challenging for DOE to meet its timeliness goals and limit Tribes’ ability
use TEFP to develop their own energy resources. Given ongoing
changes to the program, including the loss of staff and rescission of
funding, streamlining program processes and ensuring there are
designated program staff with appropriate knowledge of tribal energy
finance to review applications is particularly important. We recommended
that DOE take steps to (1) reduce the length and complexity of the
application process, (2) clarify program guidance, and (3) maintain
designated staff.
In its comments on our report, DOE also concurred with these three
recommendations and described steps it plans to take to implement them.
In conclusion, fully implementing all of our recommendations would help
DOE address the barriers we identified and ensure more Tribes can
access and leverage TEFP to generate important economic and energy
development opportunities for their communities, as well as nationwide
energy benefits.

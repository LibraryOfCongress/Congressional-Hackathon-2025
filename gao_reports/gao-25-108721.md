Letter
Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member Mfume, and Members of the
Subcommittee:
Thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss the Department
of Defense’s (DOD) development of the National Background
Investigation Services (NBIS). NBIS is an information technology (IT)
system intended for use in conducting background investigations for most
federal agencies and over 13,000 industry organizations that work with
the government.
Personnel vetting processes–including background investigations–and
the IT systems that support them are vital to determining the
trustworthiness of the federal government’s workforce and minimizing
risks to U.S. national security. In 2015, two cybersecurity incidents
compromised sensitive information in Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) systems, including personnel vetting files, on over 22 million
federal employees and contractor personnel. A year later, the President
assigned DOD the responsibility for developing and operating IT systems
for personnel vetting processes.1
Today, DOD’s Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA)
is responsible for developing and securing the NBIS system for personnel
vetting while also maintaining legacy IT systems.2 Additionally, DCSA
provides personnel vetting services for most of the government, including

term “NBIS program” to refer to the NBIS Program Management Office and its
management of the program as a whole, including related subprojects such as acquisition,
engineering, training, and cybersecurity.

conducting around 2 million background investigations each year.3 In
early 2024, DCSA paused the NBIS program after it missed multiple
milestones for Trusted Workforce 2.0–the government’s major reform of
personnel vetting. During the pause, DCSA revised its approach to NBIS,
including developing a new schedule to meet future milestones and a new
cost estimate.
This statement provides information on (1) DOD efforts to revise its
approach for the NBIS program since it paused development in 2024, (2)
our ongoing work on the new NBIS schedule and cost estimate, and (3)
the importance of sustained leadership for NBIS to achieve personnel
vetting reforms under Trusted Workforce 2.0.
This statement is based on our prior reports and testimonies reviewing
NBIS from December 2021 through June 2024, which was when I last
testified before this subcommittee.4 This work also informed our 2025
update on the government-wide personnel security clearance process––
an issue on our High-Risk List.5 This statement also includes preliminary
observations from our ongoing work examining DCSA’s new NBIS
schedule and cost estimate. To perform our prior and ongoing work, we
analyzed information on NBIS from DCSA and OPM and interviewed
officials with knowledge of the NBIS program and NBIS and legacy
systems.
More detailed information on the objectives, scope, and methodology for
our prior work can be found in the issued reports listed in the Related
3While DCSA conducts 95 percent of the government’s background investigations, some
executive branch agencies have the authority to conduct all or some of their own
investigations, according to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. Such
agencies include the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and
the State Department, as well as some DOD components such as the National Security
Agency.

topic.
5In 2018, we placed the government-wide security clearance process on our High-Risk
List due in part to challenges with IT systems. In our latest High-Risk update, we found
that the government-wide personnel security clearance process continued to face
challenges regarding the timely processing of clearances and development of the NBIS
system. We have made numerous recommendations to address these challenges. For
more information on our previous recommendations, see GAO, High-Risk Series:

Background
The Personnel Vetting Personnel vetting processes help ensure the trustworthiness of the
Process and Trusted federal government’s workforce and those who support it. Specifically,
federal departments and agencies vet personnel to determine whether

they are, and remain over time, (1) eligible to access classified
information or to hold a sensitive position; (2) suitable for government
employment or fit to perform work for, or on behalf of, the government as
contractor employees or certain categories of federal employees; and (3)
eligible for access to agency systems or facilities.
The Security, Suitability, and Credentialing Performance Accountability
Council (PAC) is responsible for the government-wide implementation of
personnel vetting reforms and is involved in setting requirements for
NBIS.6 The PAC has four principal members: the Deputy Director for
Management of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB); the
Director of National Intelligence (DNI); the Director of OPM; and the
Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and Security.
In March 2018, the PAC’s principal members initiated Trusted Workforce
2.0 to reform the personnel vetting processes. In April 2022, the PAC
issued the first iteration of its Trusted Workforce 2.0 Implementation
Strategy, which states that the reform aims to better support agencies’
missions by reducing the time required to bring new hires onboard,
enabling mobility of the federal workforce, and improving insight into
workforce behaviors. We have since recognized the PAC’s continued
commitment to reforming the personnel security clearance process in our
High-Risk reports. The PAC initially planned to fully implement Trusted

Workforce 2.0 by fiscal year 2026, but now plans to complete all
milestones by fiscal year 2028.
NBIS Development and Following the 2015 OPM cybersecurity incidents, DOD directed the
Costs Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) to lead the acquisition of a
new IT system to replace all OPM legacy IT systems supporting
background investigation processes. DOD initially planned for NBIS to be
fully operational in 2019, but it did not meet this target. The department
then transferred the NBIS Program Management Office from DISA to
DCSA on October 1, 2020, as DCSA had assumed responsibility for
conducting background investigations for most federal agencies. DCSA
also took over the ownership and maintenance of OPM legacy systems
and DOD legacy systems that support personnel vetting.
DCSA projected that it would deliver all initial capabilities by the end of
fiscal year 2023 and decommission all legacy IT systems by the end of
fiscal year 2024. However, DOD missed those targets and notified
stakeholders in December 2023 that the delay would impose additional
costs. In early 2024, DCSA paused the NBIS program and undertook a
replanning effort to change its approach to develop and manage the NBIS
system. Figure 1 shows a timeline of NBIS delays in development since
2015.

From fiscal years 2017 through 2024, DOD spent $2.4 billion on
developing NBIS and sustaining legacy personnel vetting systems.7 This
total includes around $1.1 billion that DOD initially spent to develop the
NBIS system. In addition, DOD spent around $1.3 billion to maintain
legacy systems.8

migrate personnel vetting data to the cloud and modernize the
programming code of legacy systems. As of August 2025, DCSA projects
that it will modernize legacy systems and decommission legacy data
centers by the end of fiscal year 2027. Figure 2 outlines changes to NBIS
program management since early 2024.
7This total is based on actual amounts in DOD budget justification documents for
research, testing, development, and evaluation (RDT&E) and operation and maintenance
(O&M). DOD pays for legacy systems by using two funding sources that originated from
the transition in 2019 of background investigation functions from OPM to DOD. First,
DCSA established a working capital fund in June 2019 to finance personnel vetting
activities, such as background investigations. Working capital funds recover costs by
charging customers a standard price for a product or service. Second, OPM transferred
ownership of legacy IT systems to DCSA in October 2020, but they continue to reside on
OPM’s network. Under a series of interagency agreements, DCSA will continue to pay
OPM for services associated with the legacy systems until they are no longer needed.
8DOD is responsible for OPM legacy systems that reside on OPM’s network but are
maintained by DOD personnel until those legacy systems are replaced by the NBIS
system. OPM legacy systems include the Personnel Investigation Processing System
(PIPS). DOD also maintains its own legacy systems including the Defense Information
System for Security (DISS) and Mirador, which is the DOD system of record for
continuous vetting.

## Page 9

Figure 2: DOD Actions to Revise its Approach to the National Background
Investigation Services (NBIS) Program Since March 2024
DOD also revised its approach to overseeing the NBIS program. DOD
transferred some authority over the NBIS program to the Office of the
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment in early
2024 as part of its efforts to address NBIS delays, cost overruns, and
technical issues.9 In addition, DOD established the NBIS Requirements
Governance Board (NRGB) in October 2024 to oversee requirements
prioritization, assess capabilities, and inform decision-maker review for
NBIS. For example, mission owners’ representatives gather requirements
from users of the NBIS system and communicate these to the NRGB.10
The DCSA director is a voting member of the NRGB and the NBIS
program manager is a non-voting member.

## Page 10

The NBIS program also revised its approach to engaging with external
users of the NBIS system. This includes personnel security managers at
115 federal departments and agencies and around 13,000 organizations
across the United States that work with the federal government. For
example, beginning in 2025, DCSA has been testing a Personnel Vetting
Questionnaire product that will support Trusted Workforce 2.0. Figure 3

program.

respondents to our survey of NBIS users at federal agencies and industry
organizations reported concerns with transitioning to the new system.11
We recommended that DOD assess and use our survey results to inform
its efforts to improve engagement with NBIS stakeholders.
DOD agreed with our recommendation and, in October 2024, DCSA
implemented it by incorporating the results of our survey in its NBIS
communications plan. Specifically, the plan includes several issues we
identified in our survey to improve existing NBIS stakeholder engagement
efforts. For example, DCSA discussed efforts to improve transparency,
train individuals to use NBIS, acknowledge and incorporate stakeholder

feedback, develop key performance indicators, and conduct quarterly
stakeholder updates on NBIS progress.
DOD also has implemented recommendations we made to address NBIS
cybersecurity issues. In June 2024, we found that DOD had not fully
planned for the cybersecurity of NBIS and legacy background
investigations systems and did not fully implement privacy controls. We
made 13 recommendations to address these issues and DOD has since
implemented them.12
We are currently reviewing the extent to which DCSA has implemented
cybersecurity controls for selected NBIS systems and legacy background
investigation systems. We plan to publish our report later in calendar year
2025 with limited distribution due to the sensitivity of the material covered.

13In 2021 and 2023, we reviewed two versions of the NBIS program’s integrated master
schedule, and in 2023, we also reviewed the program’s cost estimate. In our best
practices, “minimally met” means the program provided evidence that satisfies a small
portion of the criterion. For more information, see GAO-23-105670 and GAO-22-104093.
14Agile methodology is an approach to software development in which software is
developed incrementally and is continuously evaluated for functionality, quality, and
customer satisfaction. For a discussion of scheduling and cost estimating best practices
for Agile software development, see Agile Assessment Guide: Best Practices for Agile

Figure 4: GAO’s Prior Assessment of How NBIS’s Schedule and Cost Estimate Have
Met GAO Best Practices
Note: We assessed the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency’s (DCSA) schedule files as
of February 2023 for the National Background Investigation Services (NBIS) program against industry
best practices for developing a schedule published in the GAO Schedule Assessment Guide. See
GAO-23-105670. A high-quality, reliable schedule has four characteristics: it is comprehensive,
controlled, credible, and well-constructed. We also assessed DCSA’s cost estimate from 2022 for the
NBIS program against best practices for cost estimating published in the GAO Cost Estimating and
Assessment Guide. A high-quality cost estimate has four characteristics: it is accurate,
comprehensive, credible, and well-documented. These best practices are also referenced in the GAO
Agile Assessment Guide (GAO-20-590G).
We are currently assessing the reliability of the NBIS program’s 2025
schedule and cost estimate. In our preliminary work assessing the
reliability of the program’s schedule, DCSA provided evidence that it is
now working primarily with a software tool to track NBIS-related work
instead of using an integrated master schedule for the program. DCSA
officials believe the program’s current approach to Agile development
through this tool meets our best practices. We will be assessing DCSA’s
new approach to a program schedule to determine whether it meets our
best practices.
Further, our preliminary analysis indicates that DOD has taken some
action that is consistent with our best practices for cost estimating.
DCSA’s new cost estimate is based on the revised approach for the NBIS
program. DCSA estimates that NBIS costs will be $2.2 billion over the
next 7 fiscal years, through 2031. The estimate includes the cost of
migrating personnel vetting data to the cloud, modernizing the code of
legacy systems, and sustaining all personnel vetting systems. This
projected $2.2 billion in future NBIS costs are in addition to the $2.4 billion
DCSA has already spent on NBIS and the sustainment of legacy
personnel vetting systems in the previous 8 fiscal years since 2017. In
developing the new cost estimate, DOD conducted an independent cost
estimate of the NBIS program, which we have previously noted is a best

practice to verify the accuracy and completeness of Agile software
program estimates.
We are currently analyzing data to determine the extent to which DCSA’s
processes meet our best practices. We expect to report on the reliability
of DCSA’s NBIS schedule and cost estimate in Spring 2026.
DOD leadership has taken positive steps since 2024 to ensure that the

Trusted Workforce
2.0 DCSA leadership has been proactive in addressing challenges with the
NBIS program. For example, DCSA paused the NBIS program to revise
the approach to software development, program oversight, stakeholder
engagement, and other aspects of the program. At the same time, DCSA
continued to make progress implementing our recommendations.
However, with the impending departure of the current DCSA director, the
agency faces the risk that this positive progress may be disrupted. To
mitigate this risk, it will be important for DOD to swiftly appoint a new
director with the appropriate qualifications and who is committed to
sustaining this progress. DCSA leadership will be critical to the success of
NBIS and to avoid further delays and cost overruns.
Sustained leadership by DOD is also critical to addressing concerns
raised by NBIS customers and users, especially federal agencies and
contractors. For example, agencies that responded to our survey in May
2025 reported that a primary benefit of Trusted Workforce 2.0 is the ability
to access real-time information on personnel through continuous vetting,
but a third of the agencies stated that NBIS delays were disrupting
15In our High-Risk reports, we have noted the PAC’s commitment to Trusted Workforce
2.0 and have highlighted key practices that agencies should adopt to demonstrate
leadership commitment to sustain high-risk efforts. For example, see GAO, High-Risk
Series: Heightened Attention Could Save Billions More and Improve Government
Efficiency and Effectiveness, GAO-25-107743 (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 25, 2025).

implementation overall.16 Contractors also reported that IT system
inefficiencies—especially those related to NBIS—increased their
workloads.
In summary, DOD has taken steps to revise its approach to oversight and
management of NBIS. What will remain critical in determining the overall
success of NBIS, and with it Trusted Workforce 2.0, will be sustained
commitment from leadership. As DOD transitions from the current DCSA
director to the appointment of a new one, DOD must continue to prioritize
NBIS capabilities that meet customer needs and the success of Trusted
Workforce 2.0 reforms to personnel vetting. We will continue to monitor
DOD’s progress in implementing the NBIS program in our ongoing
reviews of the NBIS schedule and cost estimate, and related work.

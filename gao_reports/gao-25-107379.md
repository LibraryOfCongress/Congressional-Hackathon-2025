vehicles and rail containers at land POEs using large-scale NII by 2027.
However, some POEs lack installation space and CBP’s plans for the southwest
border omit nine passenger vehicle crossings that together account for nearly 40
percent of passenger vehicle traffic at that border. Without these crossings in its
plan, CBP risks entry of many unscanned passenger vehicles, hampering its
ability to prevent illegal drugs and other contraband from entering the U.S.

In fiscal year 2024, more than 98.4 million passenger vehicles, 181,000
buses, 13.0 million commercial vehicles, 3.6 million rail containers, and
40.3 million pedestrians entered the U.S. at 115 land ports of entry
(POE), according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).1 Within
the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), CBP is the lead federal
agency charged with a dual mission of facilitating the flow of legitimate
travel and trade at U.S. borders while also keeping terrorists and their
weapons, criminals and their contraband, and inadmissible people out of
the country.
Land POEs are a key drug smuggling route for transnational criminal
organizations. According to CBP, most illicit drugs, including fentanyl,
enter the U.S. through southwest border POEs hidden in passenger
vehicles or belongings, concealed in commercial vehicles, and carried by
pedestrians.2 CBP uses large- and small-scale non-intrusive inspection
(NII) systems, like X-ray machines, at land POEs to enable officers to
inspect travelers and their belongings, and vehicles and their contents,
without the need for unloading or disassembly to help detect illegal drugs
and other contraband.3 Since 2019, CBP’s NII program has received over
$2 billion for NII systems, which it has used to enhance inspections of
commercial and passenger vehicles and trains, and increase the number
1POEs are facilities that provide for the controlled entry into or departure from the U.S.
Specifically, a POE is any officially designated location (seaport, airport, or land border
location) where CBP officers or employees are assigned to clear passengers,
merchandise, and other items, collect duties, and enforce customs laws; and where CBP
officers inspect persons seeking to enter or depart, or apply for admission into the U.S.,
pursuant to U.S. immigration and travel controls. A single land POE may be composed of
one or more crossings.

3CBP officers use large-scale NII systems to scan entire vehicles. The process produces
an image that CBP officers review to identify anomalies that may be an indication of
contraband or hidden people. CBP officers use small-scale NII systems to localize those
anomalies, among other things.

of vehicles that are scanned using large-scale NII systems as they enter
the U.S.
You asked us to review CBP’s NII program, including its technology
implementation, infrastructure requirements, and system effectiveness.
This report addresses (1) how CBP uses NII systems during inspections
at land POEs, (2) the extent to which CBP has assessed the performance
of its large-scale NII systems, and (3) the status of CBP’s large-scale NII
system deployment and the extent to which CBP has planned for future
deployments.
To determine how CBP uses large- and small-scale NII systems during
inspections at land POEs, we reviewed documentation on NII systems
capabilities and inspection procedures and analyzed CBP data on its
inventory of large- and small-scale NII systems at land POEs. To assess
the reliability of the inventory data, we reviewed the data to identify any
errors and asked CBP officials questions to clarify any issues we
identified. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the
purpose of reporting information about the number and types of NII
systems at land POEs.
Further, we interviewed and observed CBP officers conducting
inspections of passengers and vehicles using NII systems at land POEs
within the El Paso, Texas; Laredo, Texas; San Diego, California; and
Tucson, Arizona, CBP field offices.4 We selected these locations to
include all four field offices where large-scale NII systems had been
deployed in preprimary inspection areas at the time of our site visits in
2024. We also interviewed CBP officials from the Buffalo, New York, field
office, which we selected because it was in the process of deploying a
new NII rail system. The information and observations we obtained from
these interviews are not generalizable to all POEs, but they provide
perspectives from CBP officers on how they are using the NII systems
when they conduct inspections and their usefulness in detecting
contraband. We also interviewed officials responsible for managing the
4Within the El Paso, Texas, field office, we visited the Bridge of the Americas and Paso
Del Norte crossings at the El Paso, Texas, POE; the Ysleta, Texas, POE; and the Santa
Teresa, New Mexico, POE. Within the Laredo, Texas, field office, we visited the Colombia
Bridge and rail crossings at the Laredo, Texas POE; the Anzalduas crossing at the
Hidalgo, Texas POE; and the Veterans International Bridge and Los Indios crossings at
the Brownsville, Texas, POE. Within the San Diego, California, field office, we visited the
Calexico East and San Ysidro, California, POEs. Within the Tucson, Arizona, field office,
we visited the Mariposa and DeConcini crossings at the Nogales, Arizona, POE.

NII program and acquiring new technologies from CBP and from DHS’s
Science and Technology Directorate.5
To determine the extent to which CBP has assessed the performance of
its large-scale NII systems at land POEs, we reviewed CBP
documentation on performance of these systems in calendar years 2020
through 2023 and data from fiscal year 2024—the most recent data
available at the time of our review. To assess the reliability of these data,
we reviewed the data to identify errors and interviewed CBP officials. We
determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of
describing the performance of large-scale NII systems. In addition, we
interviewed CBP officials from headquarters and DHS officials to
determine how they oversee the NII program. To obtain further
perspectives on NII systems performance, we interviewed CBP officers at
the five field offices we selected, and land POEs within these field offices.
We evaluated CBP’s efforts to assess NII systems performance against
DHS and the Office of Management and Budget guidance for reporting
performance information in operational analysis reports.6
To determine the status of CBP’s deployment of large-scale NII systems
to land POEs and the extent to which CBP has planned for future
deployments, we reviewed CBP’s NII systems deployment plans,
schedule and cost estimates, data on funding used for the NII program in
fiscal years 2019 through 2024, and DHS and CBP budget requests and
congressional appropriations.7 To assess the reliability of these data, we
reviewed the data to identify any errors and interviewed CBP officials
responsible for the data. We determined that the data were sufficiently
reliable for the purpose of providing information, as presented by CBP,
about recent, ongoing, and planned deployments of large-scale NII
systems to land POEs, and the appropriations applicable to the NII
program. We evaluated CBP’s efforts to deploy large-scale NII systems,
specifically to the southwest border, against the deployment plan

developed to meet congressional requirements directing CBP to develop
a plan to increase large-scale NII scan rates for passenger and
commercial vehicles, and rail containers entering the U.S. at land POEs.8
We also interviewed CBP headquarters officials responsible for planning
and overseeing large-scale NII deployments, managing its acquisition
efforts, and improving scanning efficiency. Appendix I provides more
details on our objectives, scope, and methodology.
We conducted this performance audit from February 2024 to September
2025 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for
our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe
that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings
and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Background
Inspections at Land Ports CBP’s Office of Field Operations (OFO) is responsible for coordinating
of Entry the inspection and processing of pedestrians, passengers, cargo, and
other items at all POEs.9 OFO has 20 field offices nationwide that oversee
115 land POEs, and each land POE includes one or more crossings. At
some of these POEs, CBP officers may process only one mode of
transportation at a crossing (e.g., commercial or passenger vehicles),
while at others, CBP may process multiple modes of transportation at the
same crossing. For example, the Laredo, Texas, POE has five crossings,
which collectively include crossings for pedestrians, passenger and
commercial vehicles, and rail. At the 115 POEs, there is a total of 186
land crossings.
At land POEs, CBP officers generally conduct inspections using a three-
phase process: preprimary, primary, and secondary inspection (see fig.
1).

aAccording to CBP officials, for rail inspections, if the officer in primary inspection determines a
secondary inspection is required, the train may be stopped immediately or directed to the nearest
railyard where the targeted rail container is separated for secondary inspection.
Preprimary inspection. CBP uses law enforcement and intelligence
information, and other relevant information such as from manifests and
past CBP inspections, to help identify and target high-risk travelers,
vehicles, and cargo for additional scrutiny before their arrival at a land
POE. CBP personnel at POEs use this information to identify high-risk
inbound cargo to be targeted for additional research and analysis and a
potential secondary inspection upon arrival at the POE. Similarly, CBP
personnel at POEs or field offices may review seizure and arrest reports,
Page 5 GAO-25-107379 Land Port Inspections


## Page 11

and other law enforcement information to identify individuals or vehicles
that have associations with known criminals and place a “lookout” on
them in TECS, CBP’s system for processing travelers. TECS will flag
travelers with lookouts for additional inspection if they arrive at land
POEs.
Primary inspection. CBP officers inspect travelers, vehicles, and rail
containers to determine compliance with certain U.S. laws and
admissibility to the country. A CBP officer interviews travelers and
commercial vehicle operators to establish the purpose and intent of travel;
asks about items acquired outside of or being imported into the U.S.;
examines travel documents, such as a passport or visa; reviews
information in TECS, including lookouts; and determines admissibility. If
the officer deems the travelers and their belongings, and vehicles and
their contents admissible, they are released to enter the U.S.
Secondary inspection. During primary inspection, CBP officers may
refer vehicles and travelers for secondary inspection. Secondary
inspection may include a CBP officer conducting further questioning of
the traveler or additional examination of the traveler, the traveler’s
documents, the vehicle and its contents, or baggage. CBP officers can
manually inspect a vehicle, offload the contents of vehicles, and use
canines to detect concealed persons or illicit drugs. In addition, CBP may
use NII equipment as part of its further inspection of travelers’ belongings,
and vehicles and their contents.
NII Program Overview Through its NII program, CBP acquires and deploys large- and small-
scale NII systems to help its officers more efficiently and effectively
conduct inspections. NII systems have been deployed to most land
POEs. Because these systems are non-intrusive, officers can conduct
inspections quickly and safely and only refer vehicles for a more costly
and time-consuming manual inspection when images from the NII system
show anomalies that may indicate the presence of contraband. Manual
inspection can involve removing contents from and disassembling or
drilling into a vehicle.
Several organizations within CBP are involved in the NII program. Within
OFO, three specific offices are responsible for managing the program:
• The NII Division is responsible for identifying and developing
requirements, developing NII acquisition strategies and deployment
plans, and training CBP officers.
Page 6 GAO-25-107379 Land Port Inspections


## Page 12

• The NII Systems Program Management Office is responsible for
acquiring, testing, and deploying the NII systems and providing input
on all project decisions for the NII program.
• The Acquisition Division is responsible for managing the cost and
schedule and defining the scope of the NII program, including
managing procurement efforts.
According to CBP officials, field offices and POEs work with these offices
to identify their NII needs—considering factors such as cargo volume,
types of crossings, physical space, and seizures—and during system
deployment.
CBP’s Office of Information and Technology is responsible for providing
secure and reliable information technology services and capabilities for
CBP and provides oversight to ensure that all deployed NII systems meet
CBP requirements. Specifically, the Integrated Logistics Division provides
NII system maintenance support, assists in developing operation and
maintenance training requirements, and monitors the performance of
contractors providing life cycle support to the NII program. CBP’s
Laboratories and Scientific Services assists CBP’s NII Division with field
testing of NII technologies.
DHS’s Science and Technology Directorate has assisted CBP with its NII
program by providing research, development, and technical testing of NII
technologies, including conducting demonstration projects for large-scale
NII systems at POEs.
NII Systems and CBP has a variety of large- and small-scale NII systems. These systems
Technologies use various technologies depending on their location and intended
purpose. Large-scale systems can scan entire vehicles to produce
images of their contents. These systems can be fixed, where they are
installed and remain in a particular location, or mobile, where they are
self-propelled and can be moved to different locations as needed.
Depending on the large-scale NII system, images may be taken from one
or more views, which can include from one or both sides, the top, and the
bottom of the vehicle.
Some small-scale NII systems can scan and produce video or images, or
measure the density of different areas of vehicles, cargo and packages,
and individual travelers with their personal items to localize anomalies,
such as those identified by large-scale systems. For example, CBP has
small-scale NII systems that can provide live video or images of hard-to-
reach areas of vehicles and small-scale NII systems that can scan
Page 7 GAO-25-107379 Land Port Inspections


## Page 13

baggage. Other small-scale NII systems help identify unknown
substances or use passive heat detection to provide a thermal heat video
of travelers.
To generate images, CBP has large- and small-scale NII systems that
use transmission X-rays with different energy levels or backscatter X-
rays, or a combination of both, and large-scale systems that use
transmission gamma-rays.10 The higher the energy level of the system,
the deeper it can penetrate objects (see table 1).
Table 1: Steel Penetration Depths of Transmission Imaging Systems at Different
Energy Levels
System type Penetration depth
Low-energy X-ray 4 inches
Medium-energy X-ray 6 inches
High-energy X-ray 11-13 inches
Gamma-ray 4-6 inches
Source: Customs and Border Protection. | GAO-25-107379
Note: Steel penetration depths are used as a standard measure of how well imaging systems can
penetrate opaque objects to produce images of the contents.
Each of these technologies has different imaging characteristics, as well
as advantages and disadvantages in their use. For example, higher-
energy transmission systems can penetrate and scan high-density and
thick objects better than lower-energy systems. However, the resulting
exposure to radiation may exceed established exposure limits.11 Lower-
energy systems scan low-density and thin objects better than higher-
energy systems. Additionally, when low-energy X-rays are used,
occupants of the vehicle can remain in the vehicle as it is scanned. With
10Transmission X-rays pass through an object, while backscatter X-rays are reflected by
the object.
11CBP follows the principle of keeping radiation exposure as low as reasonably
achievable. This is defined in 10 C.F.R. § 20.1003, as “making every reasonable effort to
maintain exposures to radiation as far below the dose limits in this part as is practical
consistent with the purpose for which the licensed activity is undertaken, taking into
account the state of technology, the economics of improvements in relation to state of
technology, the economics of improvements in relation to benefits to the public health and
safety, and other societal and socioeconomic considerations, and in relation to utilization
of nuclear energy and licensed materials in the public interest.” To meet radiation dose
limits for CBP personnel and one-time and frequent border crossers, CBP establishes
controlled areas outside of which personnel and persons who have exited their vehicles
are required to remain while a vehicle is scanned.

high-energy X-ray systems, generally the occupants must exit the vehicle
and be brought to an area to wait while it is scanned.
In addition to using different energy levels, X-ray systems use
transmission or backscatter X-rays. Transmission X-rays penetrate the
object being scanned to reach a receiver on the other side of the object
from the transmitter, while backscatter X-rays are reflected by the object
being scanned to reach the receiver on the same side as the transmitter
(see fig. 2). To penetrate an object, transmission X-ray systems generally
use higher energy than backscatter X-ray systems. Transmission X-rays
produce clear images of high-density objects, such as those made of
steel, but may produce faint images of low-density objects, such as drugs
and explosives. Conversely, backscatter X-rays can more clearly show
low-density, organic materials such as explosives or drugs, but are
unable to penetrate thick or high-density objects. Many NII systems
produce both transmission and backscatter X-ray images to take
advantage of their different strengths, which can be useful because
vehicles and their contents are diverse.
Figure 2: Transmission Versus Backscatter X-rays Used in U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Non-Intrusive Inspection
Systems at Land Ports of Entry
These differences in imaging characteristics mean that different
technologies may be more appropriate in particular situations. For

example, according to CBP, a transmission X-ray system might be the
best option for vehicles with dense cargo.12 If the cargo is primarily low-
density, organic materials, then a backscatter X-ray system might be the
best option. When the contents of a vehicle are complex, such as
including both high- and low-density objects or objects of varying
composition, then using a system that combines both transmission and
backscatter X-ray imaging may be the best option.

Passenger and commercial vehicle inspections. When a vehicle is
referred for secondary inspection, CBP officers can begin by scanning the
vehicle with a large-scale NII system to generate an image of the vehicle
and its contents (see fig. 3). Alternatively, at crossings without large-scale
NII systems in secondary inspection areas, officers may begin secondary
inspection by using small-scale NII systems or conducting a manual
inspection.

When a vehicle is scanned using a large-scale NII system, the image
generated is displayed for an officer to review and identify any anomalies
that may indicate contraband or hidden people (see fig. 4).

When anomalies are detected, officers may use small-scale NII systems
and canines to localize the anomalies. For example, fiberscopes and
videoscopes are used to view hard-to-reach areas such as inside fuel
tanks and dashboards. Handheld X-ray systems display real-time video
imaging through parts of vehicles. Density meters are used to identify
density changes inside inaccessible areas, such as door panels and tires,
that can be an indication of contraband (see fig. 5).
Figure 5: Videoscope (left) and U.S. Customs and Border Protection Officer Using a Handheld Density Meter to Inspect a
Vehicle (right)
When an anomaly is localized, officers may proceed with a manual
inspection of the vehicle to access and remove it, which can involve
removing vehicle contents, offloading cargo, and disassembling and
drilling into parts of the vehicle. If an unknown substance is found, officers
can use handheld chemical analyzers to identify what it might be, such as
drugs or explosives (see fig. 6).

As of January 2025, at land POEs on the northern and southwest
borders, CBP had 43 fixed large-scale systems for passenger vehicle
inspection, 5 fixed large-scale NII systems for bus inspection, and 19
fixed large-scale NII systems for commercial vehicle inspection.13 CBP
has deployed most of these systems in secondary inspection areas. In
addition, as of January 2025 CBP had 14 large-scale fixed, low-energy
NII systems in commercial primary inspection areas, 73 large-scale NII
mobile systems, and 159 small-scale fixed and mobile NII systems at
these land POEs. As of October 2024, CBP had more than 2,000
handheld small-scale NII systems at land POEs on the northern and
southwest borders. Mobile and small-scale NII systems can be moved
among crossings or POEs as needed. According to our analysis of CBP
data, in fiscal years 2020 through 2024, large-scale NII systems were
involved in more than 8,400 incidents of finding hidden people and
seizing contraband, including drugs, weapons and weapons parts,
ammunition, and currency. For more information about CBP’s inventory of
large- and small-scale NII systems available to land POEs see appendix
II.
Rail inspection. At land POEs where NII rail systems are deployed, all
rail containers are scanned as they slowly proceed through the system,
and the images are reviewed by an officer to identify anomalies (see fig.
7). If an anomaly is detected, the train is stopped, and officers conduct

further inspections. These inspections can include using small-scale NII
systems and canines to localize any anomalies, using small-scale NII
systems to help identify any potential contraband found, or a manual
inspection. As of January 2025, CBP had 25 NII rail systems at land
POEs.

CBP Is Deploying As part of its efforts to increase vehicle scanning at land POEs, CBP is
Additional NII Systems to deploying additional large-scale NII systems in preprimary inspection
areas. In 2021, the Securing America’s Ports Act required CBP to
Increase Vehicle Scans
develop a plan to achieve 100 percent scanning of commercial and
passenger vehicles and freight rail entering the U.S. at land POEs by
2027 using large-scale NII systems.14 In response, CBP submitted its plan
to increase vehicle scanning with these systems at land POEs to
Congress in January 2022 and submitted an update in March 2023,

## Page 20

including the steps it has taken to increase scanning.15 According to this
plan, a major cause of CBP’s limited scanning capacity is that large-scale
NII systems have been primarily deployed as part of secondary inspection
to scan high-risk vehicles. Deploying additional NII systems in preprimary
inspection areas is part of CBP’s efforts outlined in this plan to increase
scanning. According to CBP officials, as of February 2025, it is using NII
systems to scan about nine percent of passenger vehicles and 32 percent
of commercial vehicles entering the U.S. at the southwest border.
Specifically, CBP is deploying low-energy portals (LEP) in passenger
vehicle preprimary inspection areas and multi-energy portals (MEP) in
commercial vehicle preprimary inspection areas. These systems will allow
CBP to scan vehicles prior to primary inspection to identify potential
anomalies and assist in determining whether to refer vehicles for
secondary inspection, rather than only scanning vehicles referred for
secondary inspection (see fig. 8). Further, when scanning commercial
vehicles during secondary inspection, generally the driver must exit the
vehicle and be led to a waiting area before the vehicle is scanned. MEPs
use low-energy X-rays to scan the vehicle cab with the driver and then
varying energy X-rays to scan the trailer and its cargo, so the driver does
not have to exit the vehicle.

## Page 21

CBP began these deployments in 2020 as part of demonstration projects
it conducted in collaboration with the DHS Science and Technology
Directorate. In these projects, CBP deployed LEPs in passenger vehicle
preprimary inspection areas and MEPs in commercial vehicle preprimary
inspection areas. CBP conducted the demonstration projects at the
Hidalgo, Progreso, Brownsville, and Laredo, Texas, POEs; Santa Teresa,
New Mexico, POE; and Nogales, Arizona, POE. According to CBP
officials, through these demonstration projects they identified issues
related to the deployment of the NII systems, learned how the systems
perform at land POEs, and identified their impacts on operations at these
POEs. For example, CBP and DHS Science and Technology Directorate
officials told us they learned that POEs need to adequately prepare for
how the deployment of the systems will impact their operations and that
the harsh weather and environmental conditions along the southwest
border can impact construction and system performance. Additionally,
CBP officials said they learned about how much time it takes officers to
review system images and that additional officers are required to operate
the equipment and review the images.
In addition to testing the deployment of LEPs and MEPs to preprimary
inspection areas, as part of the demonstration project with the DHS
Science and Technology Directorate, CBP installed backscatter X-ray
undercarriage scanners. CBP installed these scanners alongside the
LEPs and MEPs in the preprimary inspection areas at two crossings in
Texas. Specifically, according to CBP officials, CBP installed
undercarriage scanners with two MEPs at the Brownsville, Texas, POE,
and one MEP at the Laredo, Texas, POE in commercial vehicle
preprimary inspection areas. CBP also installed undercarriage systems to
passenger preprimary inspection areas, along with three LEPs, at the
Donna, Texas, crossing at the Progreso, Texas, POE. The undercarriage
systems in Brownsville and Laredo were successfully demonstrated, and
CBP continues to use these systems at those crossings, according to
CBP officials. However, the demonstration project of the LEPs and
undercarriage scanners in Donna was unsuccessful and CBP removed
the systems from the crossing. CBP officials told us because the LEP and
the undercarriage scanner were from different vendors, they found they
could not operate together compatibly.
The LEPs and MEPs deployed in preprimary inspection areas at land
POEs are integrated into the overall inspection process. Specifically,
before approaching a primary inspection booth, vehicles drive through a
portal where they are scanned, and the images are sent to a command
center where CBP officers review them to determine if there are any
Page 16 GAO-25-107379 Land Port Inspections


## Page 22

anomalies that require additional inspection. According to CBP officials,
once they have completed the review, the officers send their
determination to the officer in primary inspection and, if additional
inspection is required, the officer in primary inspection refers the vehicle
for secondary inspection. Whether or not an anomaly is found, the officer
in primary inspection conducts the regular primary inspection procedures
to determine whether the vehicle and its occupants are admissible or if
the vehicle is to be sent for secondary inspection. According to CBP
officials, travelers may opt out of undergoing a scan by an LEP or MEP in
preprimary inspection by using an opt-out lane to drive to the primary
inspection booth, and officials at the POEs have discretion as to how
vehicle inspections are handled when drivers choose to opt out.
The LEPs and MEPs that CBP has deployed or is planning to deploy in
preprimary inspection areas provide greater throughput than the large-
scale systems currently deployed in secondary inspection areas and
enable CBP to scan more vehicles (see fig. 9). Further, CBP can
generally scan commercial vehicles with MEPs more quickly than they
can with the fixed large-scale systems currently deployed in secondary
inspection areas because the commercial vehicle operator does not need
to exit the vehicle and wait in another location, and the systems take less
time to scan the vehicles. As of February 2025, CBP had deployed 35
LEPs and 15 MEPs in preprimary inspection areas at 16 land POEs.

Figure 9: Low-Energy Portal in Passenger Preprimary Inspection Area and Multi-Energy Portal in Commercial Preprimary
Inspection Area at Land Ports of Entry in Mission, Texas (left), and Laredo, Texas (right)
According to CBP, it has detected contraband at land POEs using LEPs
and MEPs deployed in preprimary inspection areas at land POEs. For
example, CBP officials from the San Diego, California, field office told us
about a seizure of contraband that involved an LEP deployed in the
preprimary passenger inspection areas at a POE. A CBP official stated
that the officer reviewing an image of a vehicle scanned by an LEP in a
preprimary trusted traveler lane at the Calexico, California, crossing
identified anomalies and notified the officer in primary inspection who
referred the vehicle for secondary inspection. During the secondary
inspection, officers found about 200 pounds of methamphetamine (see
fig. 10). According to CBP, between May 2024 and May 2025, LEPs were
involved in 48 seizures including more than 1,100 kilograms of drugs and
$30,000 in currency, and MEPs were involved in 34 seizures including
more than 9,400 kilograms of drugs.

In addition to deploying LEPs and MEPs in preprimary inspection areas
for passenger and commercial vehicles, CBP is also deploying high-
energy NII rail systems to replace existing gamma-ray systems that they
are retiring and plans to use these new systems in the same way it uses
the currently deployed systems. According to CBP officials, the new high-
energy NII rail systems can penetrate steel more deeply than the gamma-
ray systems and therefore provide better images of the high-density
commodities that are shipped using rail. As of February 2025, CBP had
installed and begun site testing one high-energy NII rail system at the
Buffalo, New York, POE. CBP expects that such systems will be fully
operational at an additional 11 crossings by 2029.16

Division said they review a daily list of system outages, which they use to

inform their conversations with contractors who are responsible for
resolving maintenance tickets. In addition, CBP officials review a
dashboard that includes various measures of operational availability—the
percent of time systems are available to use for operations, excluding
preventative maintenance. This dashboard includes, for example, data on
the operational availability for individual large-scale NII systems, as well
as the average operational availability for all large-scale NII systems.
CBP has used these performance data to inform actions intended to
improve operational availability. Specifically, CBP’s fiscal year 2024 target
was for each individual large-scale NII system, and for the average

property and services that facilitate trade and travel.

## Page 26

across all large-scale NII systems, to have an operational availability of
95 percent or greater. However, in fiscal year 2024 just over half of
individual large-scale NII systems (51 percent) met this target, while the
overall average for large-scale systems was 90 percent.17 Officials in CBP
headquarters said they are aware of this issue, and the agency has taken
recent actions to improve operational availability. Specifically, when CBP
awarded its new maintenance contracts in September 2024, it included
penalty clauses that are intended to improve contractors’ accountability
for maintaining a targeted level of operational availability. CBP also
increased the targeted level of performance for large-scale NII systems
deployed in preprimary inspection areas. Specifically, the targets for
maintenance contractors over a 30-day period are 96 percent operational
availability for each large-scale NII system deployed in preprimary
inspection areas at land POEs, and 95 percent for all other large-scale NII
systems deployed in the U.S.
CBP Has Not Clearly CBP has made efforts to ensure large-scale NII systems are operational
Defined All of Its Key but has not clearly defined all of its key performance parameters for NII
systems. According to DHS guidance, key performance parameters
Performance Parameters
reflect the most important and nonnegotiable requirements that a system
for NII Systems
must meet to fulfill its fundamental purpose.18 This guidance also states
that once a program has been operational long enough to assess its utility
to the user, it is required to report the results of its key performance
parameters in annual operational analysis reports. According to the
guidance, this process can help agencies identify system deficiencies or
opportunities for cost savings and achieve their objectives more efficiently
and effectively. Further, Office of Management and Budget guidance for
conducting operational analysis states that current, complete, accurate,
and relevant data can help an agency make informed decisions regarding
the allocation of resources and compare actual against planned results.19
In 2015 CBP established three key performance parameters for NII
systems:
17The operational availability data include all CBP large-scale NII systems, which are not
limited to land POEs. For example, CBP also uses large-scale NII systems at seaports
and Border Patrol immigration checkpoints.

1. Operational availability. Meet average percentage of NII imaging
systems operational availability at 95 percent.
2. Inspection rate. Inspect 100 percent of all designated high-risk
commercial vehicles and containerized cargo.
3. Examination. Maintain 100 percent inspection of targeted containers,
cargo, and international mail.
For its first key performance parameter, CBP reports operational
availability results in its annual operational analysis reports, including the
average across large-scale NII systems.20 In addition, CBP uses these
data to help ensure that large-scale NII systems are available to use, as
discussed earlier. However, CBP has not clearly defined its other two key
performance parameters for NII systems or reported their results in
operational analysis reports. CBP officials said they have not reported
data on inspection rate and examination because they are unclear how
CBP originally intended to define and measure these key performance
parameters. Specifically, for the second key performance parameter on
inspection rate, officials have not clearly defined the term high-risk, noting
that its definition may change over time and across different modes of
transportation, for example, at land and seaports. Regarding the third key
performance parameter on examination, CBP officials told us they do not
know what it means to maintain 100 percent of targeted inspections. They
noted that it could refer to facilitating trade and travel while enhancing the
inspection process, but they said that without a clearer definition of the
parameter, they do not know how to measure it. CBP initially established
these key performance parameters in 2015 before these officials joined
the NII program.21
Clearly defining its key performance parameters and using them for
reporting would give CBP assurance that large-scale NII systems are
working as intended. Doing so would also help CBP identify any system
deficiencies or possible cost savings, achieve its objectives more
efficiently and effectively, and help inform future procurement decisions,
consistent with DHS and Office of Management and Budget guidance.
20This key performance parameter addresses operational availability for all large-scale NII
systems, including those used to scan passenger and commercial vehicles and rail at land
POEs.

## Page 28

Additional NII Systems Another way that CBP assesses the performance of NII systems is by
Increased Vehicle Scans, examining its progress increasing vehicle scans by deploying large-scale
NII systems in preprimary inspection areas at land POEs.22 Specifically, in
but Various Factors Limit
fiscal year 2024, CBP scanned 8 percent of passenger vehicles and 27
Use
percent of commercial vehicles at land POEs along the southwest border,
according to headquarters officials. In fiscal year 2020, prior to the
deployment of large-scale NII systems in preprimary inspection areas,
CBP reported scanning 2 percent of passenger vehicles and 16 percent
of commercial vehicles at land POEs along the southwest border.23
According to CBP officials, vehicle scans from large-scale NII systems in
preprimary inspection areas at land POEs led to almost 28,000 referrals
for secondary inspection for passenger vehicles and over 15,000 for
commercial vehicles in fiscal year 2024.
However, CBP has been unable to fully use its large-scale NII systems at
land POEs because they do not always have staff available and have
experienced system outages. Specifically, deploying new large-scale NII
systems in preprimary inspection areas at land POEs requires additional
staff to operate and review images from the NII scans. CBP officials we
met with at all four field offices where large-scale NII systems had been
deployed in preprimary inspection areas at land POEs said they did not
always have sufficient staff to fully use the systems. For example, CBP
officers at one of these POEs said that they did not receive additional
officers needed to review images from the new systems deployed in
preprimary inspection areas. As a result, some of the systems for
scanning commercial vehicles in preprimary inspection areas were not
being used during the time of our site visit. CBP headquarters officials
said they have ongoing working group meetings, during which they
discuss various ways to help mitigate these staffing challenges. For
example, CBP is considering whether images can be reviewed at regional
command centers rather than at individual land POEs, which could
improve the efficiency of operations. Officials said these ongoing
discussions are intended to better enable the agency to assess staffing
needs for use of large-scale NII systems in preprimary inspection areas at
land POEs.
22CBP’s initial deployments of NII systems in preprimary inspection areas at land POEs
have been focused along the southwest border. We provide additional details on NII
deployments later in this report.

2021 Report to Congress.

## Page 29

Another reason that systems were not used was due to outages. For
example, CBP officials we met with at four field offices where large-scale
NII systems had been deployed in preprimary inspection areas at land
POEs said that system outages had affected their operations, and in
some cases the outages were frequent or lengthy. As discussed earlier,
CBP has taken steps to improve operational availability by including
penalty clauses in its maintenance contracts and increasing the targeted
level of performance for large-scale NII systems deployed in preprimary
inspection areas.
CBP has made progress deploying large-scale NII systems to land POEs

CBP manages its large-scale NII acquisitions as part of a larger portfolio
management process, which includes multiple steps to develop plans and
other materials. They include (1) establishing future NII system
requirements, (2) prioritizing NII system procurements and deployments,
and (3) developing execution plans and acquisition strategies.
24GAO has previously reported on CBP acquisition management and made
recommendations to CBP to strengthen its management and knowledge sharing. See
GAO, Customs and Border Protection: Actions Needed to Enhance Acquisition
Management and Knowledge Sharing, GAO-23-105472, (Washington, D.C.: April 25,
2023). At the time of our review, CBP had not implemented the recommendations from
that report.
Page 24 GAO-25-107379 Land Port Inspections


## Page 30

Once large-scale NII systems have been procured, CBP has used a four-
phase process for deployment to preprimary and other inspection areas.
These four phases are:
(1) Pre-planning. During this phase CBP consults with port owners
and operators, which may include the General Services
Administration.25
(2) Design. During this phase, vendors conduct initial site and
environmental assessments of the POE. Vendors also develop
operational models for each site and develop and revise plans for civil
works and installation. CBP approves the final design following
stakeholder input.
(3) Construction. In this phase, vendors begin construction, including
preparatory civil works, such as pouring concrete or installing conduit
for electrical power, followed by NII system installation.
(4) Site activation. Final tasks include site acceptance testing and
training for on-site CBP officers. Once these are completed, the
system is considered fully operational.
According to CBP officials, making other site changes to accommodate
large-scale NII system use, such as redesigning traffic flows and adding
lanes to allow drivers to opt-out of scanning is also part of this process.
Figure 11 shows an example of LEPs operating in preprimary inspection
areas at a border crossing.

the Bridge of the Americas, El Paso, Texas
In implementing this process, CBP has contracted with vendors to plan
for, construct, and test large-scale NII systems in preprimary inspection
areas. In fiscal years 2020 and 2021, CBP awarded nine contracts—three
each for LEPs, MEPs, and high-energy NII rail—to procure and deploy
135 NII systems.26 These 135 systems represent CBP’s primary effort to
increase scanning and were determined by the amount of funds available
and CBP’s estimates of NII system costs per unit from fiscal year 2021.
As discussed earlier, CBP also worked with DHS’s Science and
Technology Directorate to deploy 11 large-scale NII systems in
preprimary inspection areas at six land POEs, beginning in fiscal year
26CBP initially awarded approximately $51 million for 12 high-energy NII rail systems and
over $480 million for 88 LEPs and 35 MEPS.

## Page 32

2020.27 Eight of those systems remained operational as of January 2025.
Additionally, in fiscal years 2022 and 2023, CBP modified the contracts to
order 10 additional systems for deployment on the northern border to
Gordie Howe Bridge, Michigan, and Peace Bridge, New York.
CBP has made progress deploying large-scale NII systems to land POEs
and using them in preprimary inspection areas. As of February 2025, 52
of the 153 systems CBP plans to deploy to these POEs are fully
operational, nearly all located at preprimary inspection areas.28 An
additional 101 systems remain in pre-planning, design, or construction
phases (see table 2). These systems include 12 high-energy NII rail
systems that CBP plans to deploy to replace existing gamma-ray systems
that they are retiring.

27CBP entered into two agreements with DHS’s Science and Technology Directorate to
support NII research and development and testing efforts, which included the MEP and
LEP technology demonstrations. The first agreement provided the Science and
Technology Directorate with approximately $64 million for support in fiscal years 2018
through 2021. The second provided the Directorate with an estimated $50 million for
support in fiscal years 2023 through 2027.
28These 153 large-scale NII systems include the 135 systems CBP awarded contracts for
in fiscal years 2020 and 2021, the eight operational systems deployed with DHS’s Science
and Technology Directorate, and the 10 systems CBP has identified for deployment to
land POEs in Michigan and New York. CBP has continued to install new large-scale NII
systems in secondary inspection areas. Systems located in secondary inspection areas
can provide better or different detection capabilities. Besides the systems it has procured
for installation in preprimary inspection areas, CBP has procured and installed three NII
systems to secondary inspection areas at crossings in San Ysidro, California; Port Huron,
Michigan; and Ambassador Bridge, Michigan.

## Page 33

Although CBP has made progress deploying large-scale NII systems,
deployments have cost more than CBP originally estimated and taken
longer than planned.
Costs for large-scale NII deployments. CBP has developed and
updated cost estimates for deploying MEP, LEP, and high-energy NII rail
systems, but costs have exceeded those estimates. More specifically,
according to CBP documents, there have been substantial increases in
costs above the original estimates for civil works and construction
activities for these systems. For example, in fiscal year 2020, CBP
estimated installation costs for each MEP to be $1.3 million, but,
according to CBP in fiscal year 2023, subsequent vendor-provided cost
estimates averaged $4.1 million per system. In October 2024 CBP
estimated that costs to complete installation of each remaining planned
MEP system would range from $4.2 to $9.7 million. CBP also anticipated
that inflationary factors could increase these costs by an additional 10
percent in the future.
In addition to system installation costs, CBP documents show that some
costs have increased more modestly or have been lower than initial
estimates, such as costs for purchasing the systems. For example,
according to CBP cost estimates, system purchase costs for MEPs
increased from the initial estimate of $4.0 million per system in fiscal year
2020 to an average cost of $4.3 million in fiscal year 2023. Over the same
period, the cost to purchase LEPs dropped from the initial estimate of
$2.2 million per system to an average cost of $1.2 million per system.
CBP officials at headquarters and field offices attributed cost increases to
several factors. For example:
• CBP officials told us the agency’s initial plans did not account for all
deployment costs. For example, in fiscal year 2021 CBP estimated it
would cost about $4 million to procure and deploy a high-energy NII
rail system at the Bridge of the Americas crossing at the El Paso,
Texas, POE. However, according to officials at the POE, the
installation requires costly infrastructure changes and, in fiscal year
2025, CBP reported that it would cost an additional $17.6 million to
complete the deployment. At other sites, officials said initial plans did
not include costs for infrastructure or equipment necessary to support
operation of these NII systems.
• Each border crossing poses different construction challenges for
contractors, some of which may be unexpected, resulting in additional
costs, safety measures, and reviews. For example, CBP officials told
Page 28 GAO-25-107379 Land Port Inspections


## Page 34

us that construction work at the Columbus POE in New Mexico to
install large-scale NII systems broke a water line, which likely resulted
in additional unanticipated costs.
• According to CBP officials and documents, the agency’s original cost
estimates for large-scale NII system deployments underestimated the
inflation rates for labor and material. For example, CBP’s fiscal year
2020 cost estimates for MEP and LEP deployments were higher than
its initial projections based on the contracts for the DHS Science and
Technology Directorate NII technology demonstrations. Subsequently,
in fiscal year 2023, CBP reported that costs for construction activities
over the prior two years had increased well above the original
estimates. Officials told us that labor costs had increased by 30
percent to 40 percent, or more in some cases.
As a result, CBP has requested and received additional funding to deploy
its large-scale NII systems and to meet its initial goals to increase vehicle
scanning rates.29 In fiscal year 2019, CBP received appropriations of
$570 million to procure and deploy additional large-scale NII systems. In
its fiscal year 2021 scanning plan, CBP projected that $520 million of the
$570 million it received in fiscal year 2019 to deploy these NII systems
would be sufficient to increase scanning rates at the southwest border to
40 percent of passenger vehicles and 90 percent of commercial
vehicles.30 However, in its fiscal year 2022 scanning plan update, CBP
reported that it needed an additional approximately $221 million to
complete 135 of the 153 planned large-scale NII installations. In the
update, CBP also reduced the projected increase in the percentage of
commercial vehicles scanned from 90 percent to 70 percent, while the
projected increase in passenger vehicle scanning remained unchanged at
40 percent.31
CBP received additional appropriations beginning in fiscal year 2020 that
have been used for the NII program. That year, according to CBP, they

systems to replace existing NII systems at 12 locations would improve scanning for
approximately 60 percent of the rail cargo entering the U.S.

received approximately $67 million to support large-scale NII system
deployments to the southwest and northern borders. In 2023, Congress
allocated $69 million for the NII program. A portion of these funds were
specified for the deployment of previously funded systems. In fiscal year
2024, CBP received an additional $201 million used to fund costs
associated with large-scale NII installation. In October 2024, CBP
reported that it had sufficient funds to finish deploying 64 large-scale NII
systems but needed an additional approximately $173 million for the
remaining 31 systems. As discussed earlier, as of February 2025, CBP
had completed deployment of 52 large-scale NII systems at land POEs.
According to CBP officials, in fiscal years 2019 through 2024, CBP
received nearly $2.12 billion in total funds for the NII program, of which
$1.2 billion was meant for procurement, installation, and construction (see
table 3). As discussed earlier, the majority of these funds were intended
for the deployment of large-scale NII systems in preprimary inspection.
CBP also used these funds to deploy large-scale NII systems to other
locations in secondary inspection areas and to support NII-related
initiatives. According to CBP officials, over the same period CBP received
nearly $920 million in total appropriations for NII operations and support
to fund salaries, maintenance, and, from fiscal year 2020 onward,
procurement of small-scale and handheld NII systems.

Time frames for large-scale NII system deployments. Concurrently
with increasing costs, CBP has taken longer than expected to deploy
planned large-scale NII systems. In its fiscal year 2021 scanning plan,
CBP proposed a 6-year procurement schedule ending in fiscal year 2027
to acquire all of the 434 large-scale NII systems that CBP identified it
needed to achieve 100 percent scanning of passenger and commercial
vehicles and rail at northern and southwest land POEs, given sufficient
Page 30 GAO-25-107379 Land Port Inspections


## Page 36

funding.32 However, each location is unique, and installation timelines to
complete system deployments have varied, as some sites have taken
longer than the 12- to 24-month timeline CBP proposed in 2021.
Initial CBP projections also suggested that MEPs and LEPs could be
deployed on a rolling basis over 4 years, finishing by fiscal year 2026.
CBP expected to complete deployment of the 12 high-energy NII rail
systems by the end of fiscal year 2024. However, as of February 2025,
CBP’s deployment schedule notes that the last high-energy NII rail
system is not scheduled for completion until December 2029.
Furthermore, while 31 of the systems have scheduled completion dates,
according to CBP the timelines are contingent on additional funds for
installation, as mentioned previously.
CBP officials identified various factors that have contributed to
deployments taking longer than expected. For example:
• CBP officials told us that major site upgrades are needed to install
large-scale NII systems in preprimary inspection areas at some land
POEs. These upgrades include, for example, construction of buildings
for image review (i.e., command centers) or installation of power and
data connections to the new systems.
• Large-scale NII systems can interfere with radiation detection systems
that are also located in preprimary inspection areas, and CBP may
need additional planning and time to resolve any interference at land
POEs, according to CBP officials.33
• Vendors have been slow to resolve deployment issues, according to
CBP officials. For example, officials told us a vendor needed over 3
months to fix issues found during system testing at one California
POE. Officials noted that multiple challenges during a deployment add
delays because vendors may be installing systems at several
locations simultaneously, and they lack the labor resources to address
additional, unplanned challenges.
32To meet the requirement specified in the Securing America’s Ports Act that CBP
develop a plan to reach 100 percent scanning of passenger and commercial vehicles and
rail containers at land POEs, CBP projected it would need 434 large-scale NII systems.
We discuss CBP’s deployment plans in more detail later in this report.
33Officials told us that the interference caused by MEPs can be mitigated using a
‘blanking’ technology that briefly pauses the radiation detection system while the MEP is
operating and vice versa. The only current means to reduce interference caused by LEPs
are shielding and distance.
Page 31 GAO-25-107379 Land Port Inspections


## Page 37

• Newly installed NII systems have failed site acceptance testing due to
extreme environmental conditions at the crossings (e.g., heat, sand,
and wind) which were not accounted for during factory testing.34
Officials told us that the four main vendors installing systems have
experienced these problems, and the additional work needed to
comply with the statements of work have led to delays in the
installation timelines.
Other challenges have also slowed deployments. In 2022, CBP noted that
long lead times to acquire raw materials needed for construction work,
such as steel or concrete, posed a risk to its deployment schedules.35
And, in prior reports, we have found that CBP’s NII programs have
ongoing staffing challenges, which have impeded their ability to complete
program requirements on schedule.36
CBP officials are aware of these factors and told us about actions they
are taking in response. For example, officials are reviewing projects along
the northern border to identify where, if funding is provided, NII system
installation needs could be considered when making infrastructure
improvements to older land POEs that require redevelopment.
CBP Has Not Included All As previously noted, CBP has developed and updated its fiscal year 2021

contraband seizures have occurred there. However, despite this
prioritization, CBP’s plan does not account for the large-scale NII systems
it needs to provide full scanning of passenger vehicle traffic at nine
crossings along the southwest border—including three of its highest-
traffic locations.38
According to CBP’s most recent update to the fiscal year 2021 scanning
plan, the large-scale NII systems that CBP had procured (including eight
systems remaining from the technology demonstration), would give CBP
the physical capacity to scan up to 40 percent of passenger vehicles and
70 percent of commercial vehicles at southwest land border POEs.39 The
plan estimated that 197 new systems in total are required to scan all
passenger and commercial vehicles at the southwest border.40 After
accounting for large-scale NII systems already procured, CBP’s plan
indicated that 62 additional systems would need to be procured to reach
its 100 percent scanning goal for the southwest border. See figure 12 for
a map of all planned NII system deployments to the southwest border.
See appendix III for a list of planned large-scale NII system deployments.

Overall, CBP estimated that it needs a total of 434 additional large-scale
NII systems to scan all passenger and commercial vehicles and rail
containers at northern and southwest border land POEs (see table 4).41

of the number of multi-energy and low-energy portals, and high-energy NII rail systems it would need
to scan 100 percent of passenger and commercial vehicles, and rail containers at northern and
southwest border land ports of entry. CBP made these estimates in its Large Scale Non-Intrusive

aLEP totals include additional systems CBP plans to deploy in secondary inspection areas.
To acquire these 434 large-scale NII systems, CBP estimated it would
need nearly $2 billion in funds. CBP has also prepared total life cycle cost
estimates for its entire NII program.42 In its most recent life cycle cost
estimate from fiscal year 2023, CBP estimated the total cost of the NII
program as approximately $5.6 billion.43 At that time, CBP estimated life
cycle costs for future NII systems, including the large-scale systems
needed to achieve 100 percent scanning at all POEs to be about $6.9

billion—$3.7 billion of which was attributed to costs for NII systems for
land crossings.44
However, the CBP scanning plan does not include NII system
deployments needed to scan passenger vehicle traffic at nine southwest
border crossings (see table 5). CBP included all nine of these border
crossings in its 2020 NII deployment prioritization, which identified
crossings needing additional large-scale NII systems and determined
their priority for deployment using factors such as installation complexity,
traffic volumes, and risk. However, the agency did not include these
crossings in its subsequent plans for deployment of NII systems to
preprimary inspection areas, nor did it include them in the fiscal year 2022
plan update.45

Among these crossings, San Ysidro and Otay Mesa in California process
the largest share of passenger vehicle crossings in the U.S., and the
DeConcini crossing in Arizona has the 11th-highest volume. CBP officials
told us that its plans have not included these three high-traffic crossings
because it has not determined how it will overcome the lack of sufficient
space to install large-scale NII systems in preprimary inspection areas
(see fig. 13). One solution CBP is pursuing, with the assistance of DHS’s
Science and Technology Directorate, is the development of LEPs that
could be installed where space constraints and interference with radiation
detectors make deployment of large-scale NII systems difficult, but these
efforts are still ongoing. Other options are to locate large-scale NII
systems in post-primary, a solution used at the Mariposa commercial
crossing at the Nogales, Arizona, POE, or to redevelop border crossings.
CBP has also installed large-scale NII systems across the international
border—for example in Canada, at the Peace Bridge crossing at the
Buffalo, New York, POE—however, this may not be possible on the
southern border.

As stated earlier, passenger traffic at the southwest border has been one
of the primary modes of drug trafficking in the U.S.46 Additionally,
according to the fiscal year 2022 scanning plan update, over 90 percent
of the total drug seizures in fiscal years 2017 through 2021 were
accomplished through large-scale NII scanning of approximately 2
percent of the passenger vehicle traffic in secondary inspection. Further,
according to CBP data, in fiscal year 2020, the agency’s scanning of
passenger vehicles in secondary inspection areas at the San Ysidro and
Otay Mesa crossings, and the Nogales POE, which includes the
DeConcini crossing, accounted for nearly 40 percent of total seizures at
land POEs in that fiscal year despite scanning less than 1 percent of the
total passenger vehicle traffic.
The Securing America’s Ports Act directed CBP to develop a plan and to
provide regular updates on its efforts to increase commercial vehicle,
passenger vehicle, and freight rail scan rates to 100 percent at land POEs
using large-scale NII systems. As part of its plan, CBP was to
demonstrate how it would reach this 100 percent scanning rate over a
period of years, the estimated costs of doing so, and a corresponding
acquisition plan. To satisfy this requirement, CBP submitted its Large
Scale Non-Intrusive Inspection Scanning Plan, Fiscal Year 2021 Report
to Congress in 2022. In 2023, CBP released the most recent update to
the scanning plan.
While CBP’s scanning plan states its intent to accomplish 100 percent
scanning using large-scale NII systems at land POEs, the plan does not
include nine passenger vehicle land crossings along the southwest
border, including three high-traffic crossings.47 These nine passenger
vehicle crossings comprise about 30 percent of total passenger vehicle
traffic entering the U.S. as a whole, which is about 40 percent of
passenger vehicle traffic entering the U.S. at southwest land border
crossings. Excluding these crossings from its plan may not provide CBP
the information it needs to ensure that it will have the necessary large-
scale NII systems in place for scanning. CBP is working on solutions to
enable large-scale NII systems to be installed at locations with limited
space, such as the three high-traffic crossings noted above. However,
without a plan for the southwest border that includes these nine

passenger vehicle crossings, CBP is not well positioned to achieve its
goal for 100 percent scanning of passenger and commercial vehicles and
rail containers using large-scale NII systems at land POEs. These
scanning capabilities could assist in the interdiction of additional illicit
goods, which contributes to the achievement of CBP’s mission.
CBP is Acquiring New CBP is in the process of acquiring new technologies intended to increase
Technologies to Improve scanning efficiency and throughput. This is to limit the substantial
increase in the scanning-related resources CBP will need to expend as
Scanning Efficiency
additional NII systems are deployed.
According to CBP’s fiscal year 2021 scanning plan, these technologies
are intended to allow it to achieve 100 percent scanning without needing
a large number of additional officers. CBP also noted that improved
inspection processes with NII systems would allow officers to carry out
preprimary vehicle scans without increasing vehicle wait times in primary
inspection.
The NII Integration (NII-I) program, which CBP established in 2019, is
responsible for these efforts. The program aims to transition stand-alone,
non-networked large-scale NII systems to a more integrated network of
NII systems capable of high-volume scanning. For example, the program
is intended to interconnect NII systems from all vendors and integrate
image review with new automation and existing CBP law-enforcement
tools such as cargo manifests containing trade and travel data. The NII-I
program is in the early stages of evaluating two technologies and a new
data management platform to improve scanning efficiency.
• Common integration platform. The integration platform is a
combination of software and hardware systems intended to collect
and transmit data from large-scale NII systems to centralized
locations or command centers where it can be more easily reviewed
and shared. In its 2024 functional requirements document, the NII-I
program identified four capabilities it needed for the platform: (1)
secure interfaces with other CBP law enforcement tools that allow
automatic associations with cargo manifests or other information; (2)
real-time transfer of scan images from any MEP or LEP system in a
standardized format to the CBP cloud; (3) remote review of NII
images by officers in a command center or other remote location; and
Page 39 GAO-25-107379 Land Port Inspections


## Page 45

(4) remote monitoring of NII system performance and maintenance.48
The common image viewer is intended to be the user interface to the
common platform. CBP closed its first solicitation for a commercial,
off-the-shelf common integration platform solution in January 2025.
• Common image viewer. The viewer is intended to allow officers to
review images produced by any large-scale NII system from a single
terminal. This addresses a key limitation of current stand-alone NII
systems, which require vendor-specific interfaces for operation and
image review and are not able to attach officer decisions (or other
metadata) to vehicle scans. The common viewer also supports CBP
plans to centralize the review of NII images into command centers.
CBP closed its first solicitation for a commercial, off-the-shelf common
viewer solution in January 2025.49
• Anomaly detection algorithms. CBP has explored the potential for
algorithms to improve efficiency, throughput, and detection
effectiveness by helping officers identify anomalies in images of
scanned passenger and commercial vehicles, and their contents,
which may need secondary inspection. In 2023, CBP awarded three
contracts to support algorithm development and one contract for
independent review of systems and design.50
Since 2019, CBP has received over $2 billion used to acquire and deploy

additional NII systems at land POEs, which are a key drug smuggling
route for transnational criminal organizations. Since that time, CBP has
made progress deploying these new systems and increasing the number

49CBP has pursued this technology since at least 2017, when it worked with the DHS
Science and Technology Directorate to develop a common user interface. That interface,
like the common image viewer, was intended to allow CBP officers to view images and
data from multiple NII systems on a single software platform. See Department of
Homeland Security, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Budget Overview Fiscal Year
2018 Congressional Justification. (October 2017)
50The DHS Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office awarded two contracts in
2023 to develop nuclear and radiological threat detection algorithms for NII systems.
According to DHS officials, these tools could work in tandem with the anomaly detection
algorithms.

systems could strengthen its interdiction efforts and achievement of its
mission.
Although CBP uses performance data to help ensure that large-scale NII
systems are operational, it has not defined all of its key performance
parameters. As a result, CBP does not have assurance that the NII
program is working as intended. Clearly defining its key performance
parameters and using them for reporting would help CBP manage the NII
program (e.g., by comparing actual against planned performance results)
and could help inform future procurement decisions.
Further, Congress directed CBP to develop a plan to achieve 100 percent
scanning of commercial and passenger vehicles and freight rail entering
the U.S. at land POEs by 2027 using large-scale NII systems. While
CBP’s plan states its intent to accomplish this goal, the plan does not
include large-scale NII system deployments to some of CBP’s highest-
passenger traffic crossings at the southwest border. Excluding these
crossings from its plan may not provide CBP the information it needs to
ensure that it will have the necessary large-scale NII systems in place to
achieve its scanning goals. As a result, CBP risks entry of many
unscanned passenger vehicles, hampering its ability to prevent illegal
drugs and other contraband from entering the U.S.
We are making the following two recommendations to CBP:
Recommendations for
Executive Action
The Commissioner of CBP should clearly define all NII key performance
parameters and report performance using them. (Recommendation 1)
The Commissioner of CBP should determine how to include deployment
of large-scale NII systems to all southwest border land POEs in updates
to its deployment plans. (Recommendation 2)
We provided a draft of this report to DHS for review and comment. In its
Agency Comments
written comments, reproduced in appendix IV, DHS agreed with the
recommendations and identified steps it plans to address them. DHS also
provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.
We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional
committees, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and other interested
parties. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO

Methodology
This report examines:
1. how U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) uses non-intrusive
inspection (NII) systems during inspections at land ports of entry
(POE);
2. the extent to which CBP has assessed the performance of its large-
scale NII systems; and
3. the status of CBP’s large-scale NII system deployment and the extent
to which CBP has planned for future deployments.
To determine how CBP uses large- and small-scale NII systems during
inspections at land POEs, we reviewed documentation on NII systems
capabilities and inspection procedures, including CBP’s directive on the
primary processing of travelers and vehicles entering the U.S.1 We also
analyzed CBP data on its inventory of large- and small-scale NII systems
at land POEs. The inventory data for all large-scale and some small-scale
NII systems were current as of January 2025, and for some small-scale
NII systems were current as of October 2024.2 To assess the reliability of
the inventory data, we reviewed the data to identify any errors and
missing data, and we asked CBP officials questions to clarify any issues
we identified. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for
the purpose of reporting information about the number and types of NII
systems at land POEs.
Further, we interviewed and observed CBP officers conducting
inspections of passengers and vehicles using NII systems at land POEs
within the El Paso, Texas; Laredo, Texas; San Diego, California; and
Tucson, Arizona, field offices. We selected these locations to include all
four field offices where large-scale NII systems had been deployed in
preprimary inspection areas at the time of our site visits in 2024, all of
which were along the southwest border. Within each field office, we
visited POEs with low-energy portals for scanning passenger vehicles,
multi-energy portals for scanning commercial vehicles, and NII rail

of Travelers and Vehicles Seeking Entry to the U.S. at Land Ports of Entry (January
2011).
2CBP provided inventory information for all NII systems in October 2024. CBP provided
updated inventory information for NII systems in January 2025. The updated data did not
include small-scale handheld NII systems. According to CBP the inventory of small-scale
handheld NII systems would not have changed significantly between October 2024 and
January 2025.

systems.3 We also interviewed CBP officials from the Buffalo, New York,
field office, which at the time of our review was in the process of
deploying a new high-energy NII rail system, one type of NII system. The
information and observations we obtained from these interviews are not
generalizable to all POEs, but they provide perspectives from CBP
officers on how they are using the NII systems when they conduct
inspections and their usefulness in detecting contraband. We also
interviewed officials from CBP and the Department of Homeland
Security’s (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate responsible for
managing the NII program and acquiring new technologies.4
To determine the extent to which CBP has assessed the performance of
its large-scale NII systems at land POEs, we reviewed CBP
documentation related to the performance of these systems, including
operational analysis reports in calendar years 2020 through 2023.5 We
also reviewed CBP data related to the performance of large-scale NII
systems from fiscal year 2024.6 These data include operational availability
and scan rate.7 To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed the
data to identify any errors and missing data, and we interviewed CBP
officials knowledgeable about the data. We determined that the data were
sufficiently reliable for the purpose of describing the performance of NII
systems. In addition, we interviewed CBP headquarters officials to
3Within the El Paso, Texas, field office, we visited the Bridge of the Americas and Paso
Del Norte crossings at the El Paso, Texas, POE; the Ysleta, Texas, POE; and the Santa
Teresa, New Mexico, POE. Within the Laredo, Texas, field office, we visited the Colombia
Bridge and rail crossings at the Laredo, Texas, POE; the Anzalduas crossing at the
Hidalgo, Texas, POE; and the Veterans International Bridge and Los Indios crossings at
the Brownsville, Texas, POE. Within the San Diego, California, field office, we visited the
Calexico East and San Ysidro, California, POEs. Within the Tucson, Arizona, field office,
we visited the Mariposa and DeConcini crossings at the Nogales, Arizona, POE.
4The Science and Technology Directorate delivers innovative technology solutions to
support DHS missions and first responders and serves as the science advisor to the
Secretary and the primary research and development arm of DHS.
5We reviewed reports from this time period because they were the most recent available
at the time of our review.
6We reviewed fiscal year 2024 because it was the most recent fiscal year for which data
were available at the time of our review.
7According to CBP, operational availability is the percentage of time NII systems are
available to use for operations, excluding preventative maintenance. The operational
availability data include all CBP large-scale NII systems, which is not limited to land POEs.
Scan rate is the percentage of vehicles scanned by large-scale NII systems. The scan rate
data include passenger and commercial vehicles at land POEs along the southwest
border.

determine how they assess the performance of NII systems, and officials
from the DHS Office of Program Accountability and Risk Management to
determine how they oversee the NII program.8 To obtain further
perspectives on NII systems performance, we interviewed CBP officers at
the five field offices we selected, and land POEs within these field offices.
We evaluated CBP’s efforts to assess NII systems performance against
DHS and Office of Management and Budget guidance for reporting
performance information in operational analysis reports.9
To determine the status of CBP’s large-scale NII systems deployment to
land POEs and the extent to which CBP has planned for future
deployments, we reviewed CBP’s NII systems deployment plans,
schedule and cost estimates, data on funding used for the NII program in
fiscal years 2019 through 2024, and DHS and CBP budget requests and
congressional appropriations. More specifically, we reviewed CBP reports
to Congress, deployment prioritization plans, life cycle cost estimates,
and the Integrated Master Schedule of recent, ongoing, and planned
deployments of new large-scale NII systems as of February 2025.10 To
assess the reliability of the Integrated Master Schedule, we reviewed the
schedule to identify any errors and missing data and we interviewed CBP
officials responsible for maintaining it. We determined that the data in this
schedule were sufficiently reliable to provide information about the
number, type, location, and estimated dates of recent, ongoing, and
planned deployments of large-scale NII systems, as presented by CBP.11
To assess the reliability of funding data for the NII program in fiscal years
2019 through 2024 we reviewed the data to identify any errors and
missing data and interviewed CBP officials responsible for managing the

data. We also reviewed congressional appropriations and documents
related to DHS and CBP funding and budget requests. We determined
that the funding data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of
providing information about the funds available to be used for the NII
program.
We evaluated CBP’s efforts to deploy large-scale NII systems to land
POEs, specifically to the southwest border, against the deployment plan it
developed to meet congressional requirements directing CBP to develop
a plan to increase large-scale NII scan rates for passenger and
commercial vehicles, and rail containers entering the U.S at land POEs.12
In particular, we evaluated the plan against the large-scale NII
deployments listed in CBP’s integrated master schedule, a list of
southwest land border crossings and POEs, and traffic volume data for
fiscal year 2024. We did not assess the completeness of CBP’s plans for
the northern border. We also interviewed CBP headquarters officials
responsible for planning and overseeing large-scale NII deployments,
managing its acquisition efforts, and improving scanning efficiency.
We conducted this performance audit from February 2024 to September
2025 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for
our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe
that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings
and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has deployed across northern and
southwest land ports of entry (POE). For each equipment type, there is a
description of how these systems are used at land POEs to inspect
commercial and passenger vehicles and railcars and their contents, and
travelers and their belongings, to help detect illegal drugs and other
contraband. The table also provides the total number of large- and small-
scale NII systems CBP has in inventory at these land POEs. Inventory
information for the large- and small-scale NII systems, except for
handheld, was current as of January 2025. Handheld NII system
inventory information was current as of October 2024.1
1CBP provided inventory information for all NII systems in October 2024. CBP provided
updated inventory information for NII systems in January 2025. The updated data did not
include small-scale handheld NII systems. According to CBP the inventory of small-scale
handheld NII systems would not have changed significantly between October 2024 and
January 2025.

Gamma-source fixed Uses low-level gamma radiation to generate a side image of commercial vehicles and their 5
portal contents. Before the vehicle is scanned, the occupants exit the vehicle and are brought to a
waiting area. The system then moves the gamma source and detector along the length of the
vehicle.
These systems are used in commercial vehicle secondary inspection areas.
To minimize exposure, a radiation exclusion zone is maintained for these systems. CBP is
phasing out large-scale gamma-source systems.
Gamma-source Uses low-level gamma radiation to generate a side image of commercial vehicles and their 1
mobile contents. This system can be operated in stationary mode or drive-by mode. In stationary mode,
the driver stops the vehicle past the gamma radiation source before the system begins the
scan, and only the trailer is scanned as the vehicle passes through the portal. In drive-by mode,
vehicle occupants exit the vehicle and are brought to a waiting area, and the system operator
drives alongside the vehicle as the system images it.
This system can be relocated and is used in stationary mode in secondary inspection areas and
in drive-by mode in preprimary or primary inspection areas.
To minimize exposure, a radiation exclusion zone is maintained for these systems. CBP is
phasing out large-scale gamma-source systems.
Fixed gamma-source Uses low-energy gamma radiation to generate a side image of each rail container and its 25
rail contents as the train slowly passes through the system.
To minimize exposure, a radiation exclusion zone is maintained for these systems. CBP is
phasing out large-scale gamma-source systems.
High-energy gantry Uses high-energy transmission X-rays to penetrate dense cargo in stationary commercial 13
vehicles to generate a side image. This system is used in secondary inspection areas.
Because this system uses high-energy X-rays, the driver must exit the vehicle and go to a
waiting area, and the system is inside a radiation shielding structure to minimize exposure.

preprimary
These systems provide a top-down image of the vehicle and can be deployed with undercarriage
scanners to provide a bottom-up image.
These systems are generally deployed to preprimary inspection areas but can also be deployed
to primary and secondary inspection areas.
Multi-energy portal Scans commercial vehicles using low-energy X-rays for the cabin and driver so the driver can 16
remain in the vehicle, and varying energies of X-rays for the trailer and its cargo.
These systems provide a side image of commercial vehicles. These systems can be deployed
with undercarriage scanners to provide a bottom-up image and can include multi-view
backscatter imaging.
These systems are generally deployed to preprimary and primary inspection areas but can also
be deployed to secondary inspection areas.

These systems scan passenger and commercial vehicles as they are driven through them and
and bus lanes
occupants can remain in the vehicle as it is scanned. According to CBP officials, for buses, the
passengers are first off-loaded for pedestrian inspection before the bus is driven through the
system to be scanned.
These systems can provide three views—which include two side views and a top view—or four
views, which adds a bottom view.
These systems are used in secondary inspection areas for passenger vehicles and primary
inspection areas for commercial vehicles. According to CBP officials, these systems are
generally used in secondary inspection for buses.
Low-energy mobile Provides a low energy X-ray image of entire passenger vehicles. One model uses low-energy 33
transmission X-rays to scan vehicles from the top down in stationary mode as each vehicle is
driven through the system. The other model scans unoccupied vehicles in drive-by mode using
backscatter X-rays to generate a side image.
These systems can be relocated and are used in secondary inspection areas.
Medium-energy fixed Provides dual-energy transmission X-ray side images of commercial vehicles and their contents. 40
portal and mobile Vehicles are driven through fixed systems as they are scanned. Mobile systems can be operated
in either drive-by mode where the system operator drives alongside the vehicle as the system
scans it, or in stationary mode where the vehicle is driven through the system as it is scanned.
Fixed systems are used in secondary inspection areas. Mobile systems can be relocated and
are used in drive-by mode in preprimary inspection areas and in stationary mode in secondary
inspection areas.

The Social Security Administration (SSA) is responsible for delivering
services that touch the lives of virtually every American. To provide these
services, the agency relies on a variety of IT systems, ranging from those
that support the processing and payment of Disability Insurance and
Supplemental Security Income benefits to those that facilitate the
calculation and withholding of Medicare premiums. The agency relies
extensively on IT hardware and software to carry out its core mission.
SSA’s acquisition workforce, which includes contracting officers and
contracting officer’s representatives (COR), plays a key role in overseeing
and managing IT acquisitions that support the agency.
We and others have reported on the challenges SSA has faced in
modernizing its IT systems and planning for its human capital needs. In
May 2014, we reported that SSA had not adequately planned for its long-
term IT workforce needs.1 In November 2023, SSA’s Office of the
Inspector General reported that SSA did not have a clear human capital
plan that addressed human capital risks, such as a large and expected
retirement wave.2 Similarly, in September 2024, SSA’s Office of the

Inspector General reported that the agency’s IT modernization program
was not effectively designed or, in some instances, had not implemented
or complied with its own processes to fully address federal requirements.3
For example, SSA did not have an approved strategy or guidance for
defining and implementing plans to modernize, replace, or retire its legacy
IT systems. Our June 2025 report also reviewed SSA’s IT investment
management processes and made recommendations to improve these
processes.4
In 2002, we reported that successful transformation of an organization’s
acquisition environment included having the right people with the right
skills.5 Strategic human capital management has been a government-
wide high-risk area since 2001 because skills gaps can undermine
agencies’ abilities to effectively meet their missions.6 These skills gaps
can be due to an insufficient number of individuals or individuals without
the appropriate skills or abilities to successfully perform their work.
Government-wide skills gaps have been identified in fields such as IT and
acquisitions. Agencies often experience skills gaps because of a shortfall
in a talent management activity, such as workforce planning or training.
You asked us to review SSA’s workforce planning practices for staff who
support IT contracts. This report examines (1) how much SSA obligated
for IT products and services from fiscal years 2020 through 2024; and the
extent to which (2) the Office of Acquisition and Grants (OAG) took steps
to assess and address its needs for contracting officers who support IT
contracts, and (3) the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) took
steps to assess and address its needs for contracting officer’s
representatives who support IT contracts.

To examine how much SSA obligated for IT products and services, we
analyzed SSA’s contract awards and contract obligation data from the
Federal Procurement Data System for fiscal years 2020 through 2024.
We reviewed contract obligations through fiscal year 2024 because it was
the most recent full fiscal year for which data were available at the time of
our review. To determine the reliability of these data, we reviewed the
data dictionary and data validation rules for the system. We determined
that the Federal Procurement Data System data were reliable for
reporting SSA’s contract obligations and number of contracts from fiscal
years 2020 through 2024.
To examine the extent to which OAG took steps to assess and address
its workforce needs, we reviewed SSA’s acquisition handbook and
training guidance for acquisition personnel, including contracting officers.
We also reviewed OAG organizational charts and spreadsheets used to
track contracting officer assignments. We assessed the reliability of these
data by reviewing OAG’s processes for collecting this data and
conducting manual data testing of contracting officer assignments, such
as checking for missing values and duplicate entries. We found the data
to be generally reliable to report the number of contracting officers as of
November 2024. We described the types of information in OAG’s
contracting officer workload spreadsheet but did not analyze the data. We
determined these data were unreliable due to discrepancies in the
number of contracts reported by OAG and OCIO, and duplicate entries in
the spreadsheet for some contracts. We also interviewed key officials
from OAG and its subcomponents.
To examine the extent to which OCIO took steps to assess and address
its workforce needs, we reviewed spreadsheets on contracting officer’s
representatives’ workloads, and documents outlining a streamlined
software acquisition process. We assessed the reliability of OCIO’s
spreadsheets by reviewing OCIO’s processes for collecting the data and
conducting manual data testing of contract assignment data, including
checking the summary data against totals provided by SSA. We describe
the information in OCIO’s spreadsheets but did not analyze the data
because we determined that the data on contracts assigned to
contracting officer’s representatives were not reliable due to
discrepancies in the number of contracts reported by OAG and OCIO. In
addition, we interviewed key officials in relevant OCIO divisions.
We assessed OAG’s and OCIO’s efforts to assess their workforce needs
against Standards for Internal Controls in the Federal Government,
specifically principle 13 on using quality information; and key workforce

planning practices and activities.7 For additional details on our scope and
methodology, see appendix I.
We conducted this performance audit from February 2024 to August 2025
in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that
the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Background
Key SSA Staff Supporting Key acquisition staff who support SSA’s IT contracts reside in OAG and
IT Contracts OCIO. These staff include contracting officers and contracting officer’s
representatives.
Contracting Officer Duties and Contracting officers are responsible for the award and management of a
Reporting Chain contract, including reviewing and approving proposed solicitations and
signing contract modifications, among other duties.8 For example,
contracting officers are expected to perform cost and price analyses on
contractor proposals, accurately maintain contract data in the Federal
Procurement Data System, and close out contract files.
Contracting officers who support IT contracts reside in OAG, which is
responsible for SSA-wide acquisition programs in support of the agency’s
mission and strategic goals. OAG’s Division of Information Technology
Acquisition (DITA) is responsible for the acquisition of IT products and
services. DITA is led by a division director and has three IT-related
branches: (1) IT Software & Maintenance Branch (software), (2) IT
Equipment & Maintenance Branch (hardware), and (3) IT Support

8Social Security Administration’s (SSA) Acquisition Handbook distinguishes between
Contracting officers, Contract Specialists, and Purchasing agents. Contracting officers are
often simultaneously a contract specialist or purchasing agent. For the purposes of this
report, we refer to all staff in the contracting job series (GS-1102) as contracting officers.

Services Branch (services). Each branch is led by a branch chief who is
responsible for assigning work to contracting officers.
OAG is led by an Associate Commissioner who also serves as SSA’s
Senior Procurement Executive. This official is responsible for the overall
management of SSA’s procurement process, including the
implementation of SSA’s procurement policies, regulations, and
standards. In addition, OAG houses the Acquisition Career Manager, who
manages the training needs and certifications for acquisition staff.
OAG is a component of the Office of Finance and Management, which is
the office that leads SSA’s budget, acquisition and grants, facilities and
security management, and financial policy and program integrity.9 This
office reports to SSA’s Commissioner. Figure 1 is an organizational chart
showing the location of SSA’s IT-specific contracting officers.

Finance, and Management. SSA renamed it in June 2025 as part of its reorganization
effort.

Contracting Officer’s CORs, who are designated by the contracting officer, serve as the
Representative Duties and technical representative assisting contracting officers with contract
Reporting Chain administration functions.10 These duties may include resolving day-to-day
matters, maintaining contract files, completing Contractor Performance
Assessment Reports, and providing contracting officers with status
updates and recommendations for corrective actions, among other
responsibilities. CORs are not involved in functions that would
contractually bind or obligate the government, including changes related
to the terms and conditions of any contract. These functions remain the
responsibility of the contracting officer.
SSA CORs who support IT contracts primarily reside in one of two OCIO
divisions, which are led by division directors:
• The Division of Resource Management and Acquisitions (DRMA)
houses CORs responsible for IT software and hardware
contracts.11 DRMA is under the Office of Systems Operations and
Hardware Engineering.
• The Division of Investment Management and Enterprise Services
(DIMES) houses CORs responsible for IT services contracts.12
DIMES is under the Office of IT Financial Management and
Support.
The offices that house DIMES and DRMA report to OCIO. Figure 2 is an
organizational chart showing the location of SSA’s IT-specific CORs.
10FAR 1.604.
11The DRMA director said that most of SSA’s hardware contracts are handled by DRMA
CORs, but that some hardware contracts are managed by CORs on another hardware
team.
12The DRMA director said that DRMA had a few IT service contracts for network
installation support services but the rest of the IT service contracts were managed by
DIMES.

Representatives, as of July 2025
SSA officials said that CORs supporting IT contracts in DRMA and
DIMES do so as their primary duty. In other agencies, COR duties may
be just one of an employee’s assigned duties.13 For example, an
employee at the Department of Veterans Affairs may have a primary role
as a doctor, but the employee may also be a COR overseeing the
performance of a contract for medical supplies. SSA officials said that
CORs supporting IT contracts are hired under the “IT management job
series” but do not perform typical duties under this job series, such as IT
help desk functions.14 Instead, they carry out the functions noted above.

Recent Executive In February 2025, SSA began efforts to reorganize and reduce its staff
Memorandums, Guidance, and consolidate its procurements, in response to executive
memorandums and orders and subsequent guidance. These
and Orders, Affecting
memorandums, guidance, and orders include the following (in
SSA’s Workforce and
chronological order from earliest to most recent):
Acquisitions
• Executive memorandums to freeze hiring. In late January
2025, the President signed a memorandum to freeze the hiring of
federal civilian employees in the executive branch.15 Within 90
days of the issuance date of the memorandum, the Office of
Management and Budget was required to submit a plan to reduce
the size of the federal government’s workforce through efficiency
improvements and attrition. Upon issuance of the Office of
Management and Budget plan, the January memorandum
instituting the freeze expired, with respect to most executive
agencies. In April 2025, the President signed another
memorandum extending the hiring freeze through July 15, 2025.16
Both of these freezes included provisions that nothing in those
memorandums should adversely impact the provision of Social
Security benefits.
• Guidance on reorganization plans. In February 2025, the Office
of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel
Management issued guidance for agencies to develop
reorganization plans.17 The guidance states that agencies should
seek reductions in components and positions that are noncritical,
implement technological solutions that automate routine tasks,
and maximally reduce the use of outside consultants and
contractors, among other things. The guidance states that
agencies or components that provide direct services to citizens,
such as Social Security, shall not implement any proposed agency
reorganization plans until the Office of Management and Budget
and the Office of Personnel Management certify that the plans will
have a positive effect on the delivery of such services.
• Executive order on consolidation of procurements. On March
20, 2025, the President signed an executive order to consolidate

agencies’ domestic procurements, including SSA, at the General
Services Administration, whose Administrator was to be the
executive agent for all government-wide IT acquisition contracts
within 30 days of the order.18 In April 2025, General Services
Administration officials said they were in the process of
transitioning certain civilian agencies’ procurement functions—
including the Small Business Administration, Department of
Housing and Urban Development, and Department of Education—
to their agency. These officials added that by mid-May 2025,
agencies were required to submit a template identifying common
spending categories that could be transferred to the General
Service Administration.
SSA’s efforts to address these executive memorandums and orders, and
subsequent guidance, include plans to reduce the size of its workforce
from 57,000 to 50,000 and reduce costs across all spending categories,
including spending on contracted services.19 OCIO officials told us that
the agency’s hiring efforts were also halted. SSA took several actions to
reduce the size of its workforce across the agency through voluntary
mechanisms. It plans to use reduction-in-force actions to achieve its
targeted workforce number:
• As of April 2025, the agency reported that 365 employees
accepted deferred resignations.
• The agency is offering Voluntary Early Out Retirement to
employees through the end of 2025.
SSA also offered all employees voluntary reassignments to mission
critical positions, which may include contracting officers and CORs.
These reassignments included positions in local field offices or teleservice
centers. Over 2,000 employees volunteered for reassignment as of March
2025 and slightly less than half of these employees were to be
reassigned as of April 2025, according to SSA.
18Exec. Order 14,240, 90 Fed. Reg. 13,671 (Mar. 20, 2025). The Administrator of General
Services must defer or decline the executive agent designation for government-wide IT
acquisition contracts when necessary to ensure continuity of service or as otherwise
appropriate. The executive order’s definition of “agency” includes but is not limited to
executive departments, military departments, and other establishments in the executive
branch of the Government. 44 U.S.C. § 3502. SSA is defined in 42 U.S.C. § 901 as an
independent agency in the executive branch of the government.

In May 2025, SSA officials stated that they planned to implement these
executive orders and related guidance, and that their reorganization
efforts could affect the IT acquisition workforce. SSA officials said they
would need to reassess and address their IT acquisition workforce needs
after implementation of the March 2025 executive order on consolidating
procurements at the General Services Administration.

Note: These data only include contracts and orders awarded from fiscal years 2020 through 2024.To
identify IT products and services, GAO used the government-wide category management taxonomy
to identify product and service codes aligned with IT and identified contract actions with those product
and service codes in the Federal Procurement Data System.
SSA’s use of different contract vehicle types varied for IT products and IT
services.23 Specifically, SSA used government-wide contract vehicles for
about 20 percent of IT service awards and over 40 percent of its awards
22The number of contracts and the value of obligations are sometimes treated as a simple
way to measure workload for acquisition staff. These data points do not account for
factors that may influence contract complexity such as the degree of technical certainty or
level of skill labor needed.
23A contract vehicle is a contract, or group of contracts, that provides a streamlined
process for government agencies to place multiple orders for certain products and
services with a preselected vendor or group of vendors.

## Page 17

for IT products from 2020 through 2024.24 Similarly, SSA used an SSA
contract vehicle for 70 percent of its new IT service awards and almost 40
percent of its new IT product awards. Figure 5 shows the proportion of
contracts for IT products and services by contract vehicle type.
Figure 5. Percentage of SSA’s IT Contract Awards by Type, Fiscal Years 2020-2024
Note: For this analysis, GAO defined government-wide vehicles as orders awarded on federal supply
schedules, government-wide acquisition contracts, and basic ordering agreements. GAO defined
SSA contract vehicles as indefinite delivery vehicles that were awarded by SSA. According to the
Federal Procurement Data System, indefinite delivery vehicles may be established through awarding
a federal supply schedule, government-wide acquisition contract, basic ordering agreement, blanket
purchasing agreement, or other indefinite delivery contract described in FAR 17. Finally, SSA stand-
alone contracts are definitive contracts or purchase orders awarded by SSA.
24Government-wide contract vehicles are a way to maximize efficiencies in the
procurement process and achieve cost savings by leveraging the government’s buying
power when acquiring IT products and services. In addition, these contract vehicles can
affect contracting officer workload because agencies can procure products and services
without the time and expense of a full and open competition for each order.

or implemented a training plan for addressing these gaps. SSA’s
implementation of executive orders and related guidance is ongoing and
could affect contracting officers’ workloads and opportunities for training.
OAG Has Limited OAG had limited workload data on contracting officers who support IT
Workload Data to Inform contracts to inform its staffing assessments. In November 2024, OAG’s
organization chart showed that about a third of the contracting officers (28
Staffing Assessments
out of 97) were assigned to DITA’s IT branches: there were 10
contracting officers in IT software, 11 in IT hardware, and seven in IT
services.25 As noted in the previous objective, SSA’s obligations on IT
contracts accounted for approximately three-quarters of the agency’s total
contract obligations each year during this period. The November 2024
staffing numbers are a snapshot and, according to the Senior
Procurement Executive, OAG’s contracting officers can rotate through
OAG’s different offices.
The Senior Procurement Executive’s fiscal year 2024 hiring request for
OAG staff was not based on contracting officer workload data. This
official submitted a request to the Office of Finance and Management to
reach a hiring limit of 120 full-time equivalents—including contracting
officers and support staff—for fiscal year 2024.26 This request did not
specify how many of the 120 full-time equivalents requested would be
needed to support IT contracts. In the request, the official noted that OAG
had 108 full-time equivalents at the time. This official said the request was
based on information related to OAG’s hiring and retention challenges
rather than staff workload data. Specifically, they said the request was
based on (1) historical staffing levels, (2) manager concerns about their
need for additional staff to reduce the burden on existing staff and help
prevent burnout, (3) OAG’s attrition rate, (4) the time it takes to train
contracting officers, and (5) past difficulties hiring higher-grade staff from
other federal agencies. The Office of Finance and Management denied

the request for 120 full-time equivalents without providing further
information.
OAG officials also told us that they received contradictory employee
feedback information on contracting officers’ workloads. According to the
Senior Procurement Executive, the 2024 Federal Employee Viewpoint
Survey showed that about 70 percent of OAG staff who responded to the
survey felt their workload was reasonable, while only 16 percent
expressed a negative viewpoint.27 This official explained that the survey
responses contradicted OAG managers’ views as they consistently
received feedback that contracting staff were overworked.
Despite a lack of workload data, discussed below, and contradictory
feedback about IT and non-IT contracting officer workloads, OAG officials
described taking actions to reduce staff workloads. The Senior
Procurement Executive said that OAG decreased its contract actions by
taking a more strategic approach to certain types of acquisitions, partly to
help reduce staff workload. As previously noted, we found that SSA’s
contract actions generally decreased from fiscal years 2020 through
2024. However, these decreases in contract actions may not account for
the complexity of the contracts, which OAG officials said is a factor for
staff assignments.
DITA also has limited workload data for its contracting officers who
support IT contracts. The DITA division director said that DITA does not
analyze individual contracting officer workloads or IT contract-related
staffing needs because the work changes every year. DITA’s division
director provided a spreadsheet in November 2024 identifying contract
assignments for each contracting officer and said that DITA’s branch
chiefs manually updated it. The spreadsheet included information such as
contract number, contractor name, contract description, period of
performance, and the estimated contract value. The DITA division director
said that contracting officers were assigned to contracts based on their
complexity, risks, and time frames; however, the spreadsheet did not
include an assessment of contracting officers’ workloads or the workloads
associated with these contracts. Further, we found errors such as
27The Office of Personnel Management Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey is an annual
organizational climate survey that assesses how employees experience the policies,
practices, and procedures characteristic of their agency and its leadership. The office
administers the survey to employees of federal agencies that accept an invitation to
participate. Eighty-four staff in the Office of Acquisition and Grants responded to the
question about “My workload is reasonable.”

## Page 20

duplicate entries in the spreadsheet for the same contract. In commenting
on a draft of this report, SSA officials said that the absence of information
on contract complexity in the spreadsheet does not mean DITA’s
managers do not understand the complexity of the work assigned to
contracting officers. However, none of the information provided by SSA
during our review showed how they factored in the complexity of
contracts in determining staff workloads.
In July 2024, OAG sought to collect additional information to determine if
it had the right number and grade level of staff across OAG’s IT and non-
IT divisions. OAG leadership requested that each OAG division submit
written staffing plan requests for fiscal year 2025. Each staffing plan was
to include the number of staff by grade and the number of contract
awards in fiscal year 2023 by contracting value, such as the total number
of contract awards under $250,000. The request for information allowed
divisions to include information related to contract complexity.
DITA did not report contracting officers’ workload data when responding
to the staffing plan request. In August 2024, DITA requested seven
additional contracting officers across its three IT branches. All three
branches reported staff departures as well as information on upcoming or
anticipated contracts. For example, DITA’s services branch described
losing two staff and noted that it was unsustainable for the remaining staff
to take on that workload. The branch also described its anticipated
contracts for fiscal year 2025 and reported information on the number of
contracts by contracting amount at an aggregate level. Additional
information on contracting officers’ workloads would have been useful to
provide a more complete picture of DITA’s current staffing capacity.
Our key workforce planning activities state that agencies should regularly
assess staffing needs and gaps in staffing, and develop staffing
requirements.28 Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government
states that key information used to achieve objectives should be relevant
and based on reliable data that are appropriate, current, complete,
accurate, accessible, and provided on a timely basis.29 Furthermore, we
28We previously established a general workforce planning framework based on federal
guidance, including the Office of Personnel Management Workforce Planning Model, and

previously reported that assessing workload data is a key component of
workforce planning.30
While OAG made an effort to collect data on the number of staff and
contract values, it lacks quality workload data for contracting officers
supporting IT acquisitions. For example, we determined that DITA’s
contract assignment data were unreliable for our analysis due to duplicate
entries. Additionally, the number of contract actions and the dollars
awarded may not provide helpful insight into actual work performed
because they do not account for contract complexity. Nevertheless, OAG
is using these data to make staffing decisions. As SSA implements recent
executive orders and related guidance, develops its reorganization plans,
and determines the extent to which procurement activities will be
transferred to the General Services Administration, SSA’s officials
acknowledged that they will also need to reassess its contracting officer
staffing needs to ensure it can accomplish its future goals. Informing such
an assessment with quality workload data will enable OAG to more
accurately determine whether its contracting officers can support current
and future IT contracting needs.
SSA Assessed Contracting SSA assessed the capabilities of all its contracting officers, which include
Officers’ Competencies, those that support IT contracts, but has not developed a training plan to
address skills gaps it identified. In November 2024, SSA’s Office of
but OAG Lacks a Training
Human Resources worked with a contractor to adapt the federal
Plan to Address Identified
contracting competency model and assess the capabilities of the
Skill Gaps agency’s contracting officers by grade level (from GS-7 to GS-15).31 The
assessment compared contracting officers against varying degrees of
expected proficiency at each grade level.32 According to an SSA official,
this assessment was part of an agencywide strategic workforce planning
effort to identify workforce skills gaps, among other things. Table 1
30GAO, DOJ Workforce Planning: Grant-Making Components Should Enhance the Utility
of Their Staffing Models, GAO-13-92 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 14, 2012)
31The general schedule classification and pay system covers most federal employees in
professional, technical, administrative, and clerical positions. The general schedule has 15
grades—GS-1 is the lowest and GS-15 is the highest. According to OAG officials,
contracting officers at GS-7 to GS-11 are generally considered to be junior staff, and
supervisory positions begin at GS-13.
32The contractor developed a draft competency model and solicited input from
representative groups of nonsupervisory and supervisory level contracting officers on the
expected proficiency levels, at each grade level, for each competency.

GAO-25-107437
Note: To develop this competency model, SSA’s contractor adapted the Department of Defense contracting competency model—which Office of
Management and Budget guidance identified as being the standard for federal contracting specialists—to align with SSA’s technical competency model
structure. Specifically, the contractor customized the competency definitions and example behaviors for SSA.
This assessment identified competency gaps for contracting officers at
higher grades and no gaps for contracting officers at lower grades.
Specifically, contracting officers at lower grades (GS-7 to GS-11) met or
exceeded expected proficiency levels in all seven competencies. On the
other hand, the competency assessment found that contracting officers at
higher grades (GS-12 to GS-15) had deficiencies across three to seven
competencies.
Furthermore, the assessment identified deficiencies in the Contracting
Principles area across all higher grades. For example, contracting officers
at the GS-12 level were expected to have an advanced level of
proficiency (i.e., applies the competency in considerably difficult
situations, and requires little to no guidance) for this competency. Instead,
the assessment found that these contracting officers had an intermediate
level of proficiency (i.e., applies the competency in difficult situations, and
requires occasional guidance). The November 2024 competency
assessment report recommended that SSA provide targeted training and
Page 18 GAO-25-107437 Social Security Administration


## Page 23

development on the competencies that had lower proficiency levels than
expected.
OAG does not have an updated training plan to address the competency
gaps for contracting officers. Furthermore, OAG’s Training Plan for
Purchasing Agents and Contract Specialists from 2019 describes general
training guidance for contracting officers but has not been updated to
align with current Federal Acquisition Certification requirements. OAG
officials acknowledged that they have not updated this training plan.
Nevertheless, despite not updating the 2019 Training Plan or having a
plan to do so, they said that SSA’s Acquisition Career Manager is seeking
training opportunities to address the competency gaps. In commenting on
this draft, SSA officials did not say when they will update the 2019
Training Plan but noted that they intend to document training
opportunities to address the competency gaps in a revised fiscal year
2026 training schedule.
Our key workforce planning activities state that agencies should develop
strategies and plans to address gaps in competencies and implement
activities to address gaps.33 SSA’s contracting officers, including those
who support IT contracts, may not be aware of the competency gaps
identified and what courses would be needed to address them, if specific
training is not included in an updated OAG training plan. Given the time
since the last training plan update in 2019 and ongoing organizational
changes, it is unclear that SSA will prioritize the implementation of
trainings to address the acquisitions-related competency gaps identified.
Developing and implementing a training plan that addresses the
acquisitions-related competency gaps identified for contracting officers,
including those who support IT contracts, remains vital as it would help
OAG ensure that its contracting officers have the skills to support SSA’s
current and future IT contracting needs.

software contracts and 25 supported IT hardware contracts within DRMA
(34 combined).35 DRMA’s director said this was about half of the
division’s staff allocation of 65 staff. The other 17 CORs supported IT
service contracts within DIMES.36 DIMES’s acting director stated that this
division was also understaffed but did not provide information on the
unit’s staff allocation as DRMA’s director did.
In late 2024, DRMA and DIMES told us that they were understaffed with
CORs due to staff departures and hiring constraints.
• Staff departures. In October and November 2024, both DRMA
and DIMES officials told us that some of their CORs had left SSA
and had not been replaced. DRMA documentation showed that
since 2020, DRMA lost 15 CORs and hired three. The DIMES
acting director said the division did not replace several CORs who
had left, but could not provide additional details; this official had
been recently appointed. These directors described two primary
34As of September 2024, SSA had nearly 900 CORs agencywide who may have

staff who had the Federal Acquisition Certification for CORs and an active account in

35In May 2025, SSA officials stated that DRMA’s IT Software Area moved to DIMES and
that the IT Software Area had eight CORs. They added that DRMA had two CORs.
36In May 2025, SSA officials said that DIMES had five CORs in the IT Services area.

causes for COR departures: retirements and CORs seeking
promotion opportunities at other agencies.37
• Hiring constraints. In October 2024, DRMA and DIMES directors
told us that they were understaffed due to COR hiring constraints.
The directors said OCIO retains authority over all vacancies within
OCIO. When staff depart from DRMA or DIMES, those open
positions (i.e., “hiring slots”) return to OCIO and may be
redistributed to other offices. However, OCIO also reported that
the office as a whole was facing workforce shortages beyond
CORs.
COR Shortages Halted a DRMA’s shortage of CORs supporting IT software contracts caused SSA
Streamlined Acquisition to pause a streamlined IT acquisition process for software contracts,
according to SSA officials. This streamlined process, which the DRMA
Process for Software
director said was paused in June 2024, applied to all software acquisition
Contracts
requests. Its intent was to centralize SSA’s software licensing purchases
and leverage negotiated discounts, among other things. SSA
documentation stated that this process resulted in $430 million in cost
savings from fiscal years 2013 through 2024.
According to SSA documentation, DRMA does not have enough CORs to
support the streamlined acquisition process. Specifically, DRMA needed
33-35 full-time CORs to support the streamlined acquisition process for
software contracts. Under this process, CORs reviewed the current
inventory of SSA-owned licenses to identify those that could be used to
meet requirements before moving forward with a purchase. CORs also
assisted in the development of pre-award planning documents for new IT
contracts, such as the requests for information and analyses of
alternatives. As noted above, DRMA had nine CORs assigned to software
acquisitions in November 2024.
Without the streamlined process, SSA officials said that awarding
software contracts will be more time-consuming and potentially lead to
higher costs. OCIO officials said that SSA customers in need of software
will have to work directly with OAG contracting officers to plan software
purchases, rather than working with DRMA’s CORs to do so. In
November 2024, the Senior Procurement Executive said that software
COR shortages also contributed to late requirement submissions to
contracting officers, which could delay contract awards. This official told
37According to a 2024 SSA exit survey, retirement eligibility and career advancement
opportunities were also common causes for staff departures in OCIO as a whole (42
percent retirements, 9 percent leaving for other agencies).

## Page 26

us that contracting officers could handle delayed software requirements in
the past because DRMA CORs served as an intermediary between SSA
customers in need of software and the contracting officers who award
contracts. We are not making a recommendation to SSA on re-instituting
the streamlined process because SSA’s reorganization efforts are
underway.
OCIO Conducted Limited Within OCIO, DRMA and DIMES have conducted limited assessments of
Assessments of COR IT hardware and services COR workloads. According to the DRMA and
DIMES directors, the number of contracts that a COR supports varies
Workloads for IT Hardware
depending on the complexity of the contracts assigned. Complex
and Services
contracts have an alternate or secondary COR to ensure adequate
oversight of the contract. OCIO provided us with spreadsheets showing
the CORs’ workloads, which officials said were monitored and reviewed
on a regular basis. However, the spreadsheets assessed workloads for
software CORs but not for hardware and services CORs.
• DRMA’s spreadsheet for software CORs from November 2024
shows that eight of nine staff exceeded a full workload.38 DRMA’s
definition of a full workload accounts for the number of contracts
and the amount of work associated with each contract, such as
the level of vendor interaction required. Each contract is classified
as being in one of six tiers, which have varying definitions for a full
workload. For example, tier one contracts are defined as those
that require the COR to spend 75 percent of their time on the
contract; being assigned to a single tier one contract represents a
complete workload for one COR. In contrast, a tier six contract is
less than $100,000 and generally requires attention once a year;
the analysis states that a COR will be able to handle over 50 tier
six contracts for a complete workload.
• Spreadsheets for service and hardware CORs identified limited
contract assignment information. For example, OCIO initially
provided spreadsheets that lacked contract numbers while
subsequent spreadsheets included them; however, none of the
spreadsheets included information on the complexity of staff
workloads. OCIO officials did not tell us why the service and
hardware CORs’ spreadsheets did not include workload analysis
as DRMA does for its software CORs.
38This analysis was for contract renewals only.

Our key IT workforce planning practices state that agencies should
regularly assess staffing needs, as well as gaps in staffing.39 In addition,
Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that key
information used to achieve objectives should be relevant and based on
reliable data that are appropriate, current, complete, accurate, accessible,
and provided on a timely basis.40 We also previously reported that
assessing workload data is a key component of workforce planning.41
Further, Office of Management and Budget guidance states that COR
assignments should consider risk factors, such as complexity and
contract type.42
As SSA implements recent executive orders and related guidance,
develops its reorganization plans, and determines the extent to which
procurement activities will be transferred to the General Services
Administration, SSA officials acknowledged that they will also need to
reassess its COR staffing needs to ensure it can accomplish its future
goals. As we previously noted, OCIO’s software COR shortages caused
the agency to halt a streamlined acquisition process that had produced
reported cost savings. Without comprehensive assessments of COR
staffing needs using quality workload data, OCIO might have difficulty
determining whether its CORs can support its current and future IT
contracting needs.

We and others have reported on the challenges SSA has faced in
Conclusions
modernizing its IT systems and planning for its human capital needs.
Addressing these challenges will be key as SSA implements recent
executive orders and related guidance, develops its reorganization plans,
and determines the extent to which procurement activities will be
transferred to the General Services Administration. More than 20 years
ago, we identified that strategic human capital management was critical to
transforming the cultures of government agencies, including having the
right people with the right skills to successfully change the acquisition
environment. SSA officials acknowledged that they will need to reassess
and address their IT acquisition workforce needs after implementation of
the executive order on consolidating procurements.43
To operate effectively in this changing acquisition environment, SSA
needs quality workload data and well-trained contracting staff to support
IT contracts. It is important for offices managing contracting officers and
CORs who support IT contracts to determine their staffing needs using
quality workload data to ensure SSA can accomplish its future goals. In
addition, it is important for SSA to develop a training plan to address
known competency gaps for contracting officers so that they are equipped
to support SSA’s current and future contracting needs.
We are making the following three recommendations to SSA to inform its
Recommendations for
decisions as the current reorganization unfolds:
Executive Action
The SSA Commissioner should ensure that the Senior Procurement
Executive assesses and documents IT contracting officers’ staffing needs
based on quality workload information, such as the quantity and
complexity of individual workloads. (Recommendation 1)
The SSA Commissioner should ensure that the Senior Procurement
Executive develops and implements a training plan that addresses
acquisitions-related competency gaps identified for IT contracting officers.
(Recommendation 2)
The SSA Commissioner should ensure that the Chief Information Officer
assesses and documents IT contracting officer’s representatives’ staffing
needs based on quality workload information, such as the quantity and
complexity of individual workloads. (Recommendation 3)

Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and
Methodology
Methodology
This report examines (1) how much the Social Security Administration
(SSA) obligated for IT products and services from fiscal years 2020
through 2024; and the extent to which (2) the Office of Acquisition and
Grants (OAG) took steps to assess and address its needs for contracting
officers who support IT contracts, and (3) the Office of the Chief
Information Officer (OCIO) took steps to assess and address its needs for
contracting officers’ representatives (COR) who support IT contracts.
To examine how much SSA obligated for IT products and services from
fiscal years 2020 through 2024, we relied on information from the Federal
Procurement Data System.1 We reviewed contract obligations through
fiscal year 2024 because it was the most recent full fiscal year for which
data were available at the time of our review. To assess the reliability of
these data, we reviewed the data dictionary and data validation rules for
the system. We also reviewed SSA’s quality reports for this data system
and excluded data fields that were identified as having accuracy issues.
Specifically, we excluded fiscal year 2019 data from our analysis because
SSA’s quality report stated that the “base and all options value” data field
had accuracy issues in that year. We also excluded the “extent
competed” data field due to accuracy issues in fiscal years 2020, 2021,
and 2023. We determined that the Federal Procurement Data System
data were reliable for reporting SSA’s contract obligations and number of
contracts from fiscal years 2020 through 2024.
Also for objective one, to analyze SSA’s IT contract actions from fiscal
years 2020 through 2024, we created an ad hoc query on SAM.gov to
identify contract action reports awarded by SSA. To identify IT products
and services, we used the government-wide category management
taxonomy to identify product and service codes aligned with IT, and we
identified contract actions with those product and service codes in the
Federal Procurement Data System. To categorize contract actions by
type of contracting vehicle, we grouped contracts as stand-alone
contracts, government-wide vehicles, and SSA vehicles, as follows:
• Stand-alone contracts include definitive contracts and purchase
orders;
1The Federal Procurement Data System is the central repository for capturing information
on federal contracting that is managed by the General Services Administration. Federal
agencies, including SSA, are responsible for collecting and reporting data into the system
as required by the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). See FAR subpart 4.6.

• Government-wide vehicles include orders on Government-Wide

• SSA vehicles include all Blanket Purchase Agreements awarded
by SSA, calls (orders) on those Blanket Purchase Agreements,
Indefinite Delivery Contracts awarded by SSA, and orders on

To examine the extent to which OAG took steps to assess and address
its IT contracting officer workforce needs:
• We reviewed SSA’s Acquisition Handbook, dated January 2024;
training guidance; position descriptions; staffing plans submitted
by OAG’s offices, including the Division of IT Acquisitions (DITA);
delegation memorandums for the Senior Procurement Executive
and the Acquisition Career Manager; and OAG’s Federal
Employee Viewpoint survey results for 2024.
• We reviewed SSA’s November 2024 competency assessment
report for contracting officers. SSA’s Office of Human Resources
worked with the Center for Organizational Excellence to (1)
develop, validate, and assess technical competencies for
contracting officers, and (2) identify trainings to close technical
skill gaps.
• We interviewed several key OAG staff, including the Senior
Procurement Executive/Associate Commissioner of OAG, Deputy
Associate Commissioner of OAG, the Acquisition Career
Manager, and the DITA division director. Our interviews covered
their roles and responsibilities, contract assignment processes,
contracting officer rotations, staffing needs and challenges,
workload analysis, changes in SSA’s IT contract awards in recent
years, competency assessments, training requirements and
offerings, and their involvement in SSA’s human capital planning
efforts.
• We interviewed officials from SSA’s Office of Human Resources to
collect information on the contracting officer competency
assessment.
• We reviewed OAG organizational charts and information provided
by DITA on contracting officer assignments. To determine the
reliability of these data, we requested information about how OAG
collected this information, identified data limitations, and
conducted data testing of contracting officer assignments, such as
Page 27 GAO-25-107437 Social Security Administration

Methodology
checking for missing values and duplicate entries. We determined
that the reliability of OAG’s organizational charts was sufficient to
report the number of contracting officers as of November 2024.
We described the types of information in DITA’s spreadsheet at a
high-level in our report but did not analyze the data—we
determined that DITA’s spreadsheets were unreliable for reporting
which contracts were assigned to each contracting officer because
of discrepancies in the number of contracts reported by OAG and
OCIO. OAG officials said the spreadsheet is updated manually
and there can be lags in updating the data when staff rotate to
other offices. We found duplicate entries in the spreadsheet for
some contracts. We also found that there was a mismatch in the
reported number of IT contracts supported by contracting officers
versus the reported number supported by the CORs in the
Division of Resource Management and Acquisitions (DRMA) and
the Division of Investment Management and Enterprise Services
(DIMES). Neither office could confirm information as to why these
discrepancies were present.
• We assessed OAG’s efforts to assess its workforce needs against
Standards for Internal Controls in the Federal Government,
specifically principle 13 on using quality information; and a general
version of key workforce planning practices and activities.2
To examine the extent to which OCIO took steps to assess and address
its COR IT workforce needs:
• We reviewed documentation on COR position descriptions, the
centralized IT acquisition process, and OCIO’s survey report of its
staff who separated from the agency in fiscal year 2024.
• We interviewed the DRMA division director and DIMES acting
division director about their roles and responsibilities, COR
assignment process, staffing needs and challenges, workload
analysis, and the plans to centralize and streamline the IT
acquisition process.
• We reviewed spreadsheets provided by DRMA and DIMES on
COR workloads, as well as data provided by OAG on the number
2GAO, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, GAO-14-704G
(Washington, D.C.: Sept. 10, 2014). We applied a general version of our key workforce
planning practices and activities. These practices and activities were based on an IT
workforce planning framework for assessing federal agencies’ IT workforce planning
efforts. See GAO, Data Science: NIH Needs to Implement Key Workforce Planning
Activities, GAO-23-105594 (Washington, D.C.: June 22, 2023).

of staff who held a Federal Acquisition Certification for CORs.
OAG provided a report that combines data from the Federal
Acquisition Institute’s Cornerstone OnDemand system with SSA’s
contract writing system. We determined the reliability of these data
by requesting information on data collection methods, identifying
data limitations, and conducting data tests of contract assignment
data, including checking the summary data against totals provided
by SSA. We determined that the total number of staff who held the
Federal Acquisition Certification for CORs and had an active
account in SSA’s contract writing system as of September 2024
was sufficiently reliable for us to report. We described the
information in OCIO’s spreadsheets but did not analyze the data—
we determined that OCIO’s data were unreliable for reporting
which contracts CORs were assigned to because of discrepancies
in the number of contracts reported by OAG and OCIO. We found
a mismatch in the reported number of IT contracts supported by
contracting officers versus the reported number supported by the
CORs in DRMA and DIMES. Neither office could confirm
information as to why these discrepancies were present.
• We assessed DRMA’s and DIMES’s efforts to assess their
workforce needs against Standards for Internal Controls in the
Federal Government, specifically principle 13 on using quality
information; and key IT workforce planning practices and
activities.3
We conducted this performance audit from February 2024 to August 2025
in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that
the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives.
3GAO-14-704G. We applied IT workforce planning practices, which were developed
based on federal laws and Office of Management and Budget and Office of Personnel
Management guidance on IT workforce planning activities. See GAO, IT Workforce: Key
Practices Help Ensure Strong Integrated Program Teams; Selected Departments Need to
Assess Skill Gaps, GAO-17-8 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 30, 2016).

Information technology is critical to the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS)
mission to provide America’s taxpayers top quality service by helping
them understand and meet their tax responsibilities and enforce the law
with integrity and fairness. In August 2022, Congress appropriated billions
of dollars to IRS through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA),
including approximately $4.8 billion to be used for business systems
modernization.1 The appropriated amounts are to remain available
through the end of fiscal year 2031. IRS stated that it planned to use the
funding to transform the way the agency carries out its mission and in
April 2023 issued a strategic plan to guide its transformation efforts.2 IRS
began carrying out programs to implement the IT vision outlined in this
strategic plan. However, as discussed later in this report, in March 2025,
the agency paused its efforts in order to reevaluate its priorities.

1832 (2022). Significant amounts of funding to IRS originally appropriated under the IRA
has since been rescinded. However, the rescinded amounts did not apply to IT
modernization.

Applicable Appropriations Committee reports include a provision for GAO
to review the performance of IRS’s major IT projects.3 This includes
assessing the cost and schedule of these projects, with particular focus
on the programs identified in the IRS quarterly reports to Congress. This
report is the latest in a series of annual reviews we have been performing
of IRS’s IT modernization efforts.4
Our objectives for this review were to (1) summarize IRS’s reported cost
and schedule performance progress for its modernization programs for
fiscal year 2024; and (2) determine whether IRS’s modernization program
plans are consistent with best practices and aligned with its strategic
vision.
For our first objective, we summarized IRS’s reported planned versus
actual cost and schedule for its modernization program projects delivered
in fiscal year 2024, as reported in quarterly IT status reports to Congress.
We also reviewed and verified the performance data in the quarterly
reports by comparing draft quarterly reports to final reports. If any
discrepancies or anomalies were detected in the performance data, we
followed up with IRS officials.
For the second objective, we analyzed fiscal year 2024 modernization
program plans against best practices identified in prior GAO work.5
Additionally, we assessed modernization program documentation to
identify linkages to IRS’s IRA Strategic Operating Plan (SOP) and
supporting documents. In particular, we sought to determine the extent to

which IRS had aligned modernization programs with its strategic
technology objective.
For both objectives, we also interviewed relevant officials in IRS’s IT
organization and Transformation Strategy Office which had responsibility
for implementing the SOP.6 A detailed discussion of our objectives,
scope, and methodology can be found in appendix I.
We conducted this performance audit from May 2024 to September 2025
in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that
the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives.
IRS relies extensively on IT to annually collect more than $4.9 trillion in
Background
taxes, distribute more than $640 billion in refunds, and carry out its
mission of providing service to America’s taxpayers in meeting their tax
obligations. As previously mentioned, IT plays a critical role in enabling
IRS to carry out its mission and responsibilities. According to IRS, the
agency spent about $2 billion on IT modernization during fiscal year 2024,
all funded by the IRA, and about $5 billion overall on IT.7 In addition, from
fiscal year 2020 through fiscal year 2024, the agency spent $6 billion on
modernization and $19 billion overall on IT.
As of September 2024, IRS was pursuing a number of important IT
modernization programs. The programs addressed some of IRS’s most
critical taxpayer services and business functions and included:
• Individual Master File (IMF) Modernization. This program is
intended to modernize and replace the IMF, IRS’s authoritative data
source for individual tax account data which accounts for a large
portion of tax processing activities. Virtually all IRS information system
applications and processes depend on output, directly or indirectly,
from this data source. IRS began the modernization of IMF in 2009,
and, as of September 2024, was planning to complete it in fiscal year
6In March 2025, IRS officials said the Transformation and Strategy Office had been
disbanded.
7Of the $2 billion spent on IT modernization, IRS reported that it spent $1.5 billion on the
IT modernization programs which are tracked in quarterly reports to Congress. We
discuss this spending in greater detail later in this report.

## Page 8

2028. IRS had spent $2 billion on the modernization of this program
through September 2024.
• Business Master File (BMF). This program is intended to provide a
modernized business taxpayer account enabling near real-time
processing with a robust database for account posting, settlement,
and service-driven data access. IRS began the modernization of BMF
in April 2024 and, as of September 2024, was planning to complete it
in fiscal year 2029. IRS had spent $83 million modernizing BMF
through September 2024.
• Digitalization. This program, among other things, is intended to
increase the digital intake of returns, correspondence, and other forms
for faster processing by accepting images of paper documents from
taxpayers and digitizing paper submissions. IRS initiated the program
in February 2021, and, as of September 2024, had planned to
complete it by September 2027. IRS had spent $248 million on this
program through September 2024.
• Enterprise Case Management (ECM). This program is intended to
establish a single, modernized, enterprise case management system
with access to taxpayer data and standard business processes across
the IRS. IRS initiated the program in October 2015 and had, as of
September 2024, planned to complete it by end of fiscal year 2026.
IRS had spent $634 million on the modernization of ECM through
September 2024.
IRS Modernization Plans To support its IT modernization efforts, IRS publicly issued its agency-
and Reports to Congress wide IRA SOP in April 2023.8 According to IRS, the plan combined and
evolved several existing plans, including the April 2019 Integrated
Business Modernization Plan that previously guided IRS’s IT
modernization work. The IRA SOP identified five objectives the agency
planned to accomplish through year 2031:
• Dramatically improve services to help taxpayers meet their obligations
and receive the tax incentives for which they are eligible.
• Quickly resolve taxpayer issues when they arise.
• Focus expanded enforcement on taxpayers with complex tax filings
and high-dollar noncompliance to address the tax gap.

• Deliver cutting-edge technology, data, and analytics to operate more
effectively.
• Attract, retain, and empower a highly skilled, diverse workforce and
develop a culture that is better equipped to deliver results for
taxpayers.
The SOP’s fourth objective focuses on IRS’s improvements to its IT
infrastructure, including the agency’s plans to retire legacy programs and
systems and to modernize IT. The plan also states that many programs
supporting other objectives depend on the modernization of IRS’s core IT
infrastructure. In March 2024, we reported that IRS had not yet updated
its modernization program plans to align with the SOP.9 Officials stated
they were working on an enterprise roadmap that would help guide
updates to the modernization program plans. We recommended that IRS
complete the roadmap and ensure it addresses the strategic operating
plan’s technology objective.
In response, in January 2025, IRS provided its updated Enterprise
Transformation Roadmap for calendar years 2023 to 2026 to guide the
implementation of the strategic plan. However, while the roadmap
identified outcomes, outcome groupings, and key results with milestones
and timelines for measuring progress, it did not specifically address the
technology strategic objective.
As noted earlier and discussed in greater detail later in this report, in
March 2025, IRS paused work on its modernization programs. In June
2025, IRS officials shared a draft of a new framework, including nine
initiatives it intends to pursue instead of the previously mentioned 23
programs.
IRS is statutorily mandated to report to Congress on the status of its
modernization efforts through quarterly reports.10 In these quarterly
reports, IRS is required to, among other things, summarize
accomplishments for the previous quarter and identify plans, including
associated costs and schedule, for the upcoming quarter. The agency
also identifies changes to programs’ cost, schedule and scope in program

summaries within the quarterly reports. In April 2025, IRS paused sending
quarterly reports but officials reported that they are currently working to
restart them.
Prior GAO Reporting on Over the past several years, and in addition to the report previously cited,
Opportunities for we have reported on the performance of IRS’s IT investments and
identified numerous opportunities for improvement. For example:
Improvement at IRS
• In June 2018, we reviewed the performance of several IRS
investments, including legacy systems.11 We found, among other
things, that these legacy systems were facing significant risks due to
their reliance on legacy programming languages, outdated hardware,
and a shortage of staff with critical skills. In addition, IRS had not fully
implemented key risk management practices to effectively mitigate
those risks.
As a result of these and other findings in our report, we made 21
recommendations to IRS. As of February 2024, IRS had implemented
all the recommendations.
• In October 2021, we reported on IRS’s use of outdated assembly
language code and Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL)
for its IMF, and on the status of the agency’s efforts to replace the
program.12 We noted that IRS had a plan for replacing and retiring
IMF, with a 2030 milestone for full replacement. The milestone,
however, meant that for many years IRS would still have to contend
with the numerous challenges associated with the system’s age and
reliance on an old programming language warranting consistent high-
level management attention.
In addition, we found that while Customer Account Data Engine 2
(CADE 2) had lower than expected costs for 2020 and was within
schedule parameters for 2019 and 2020, IRS had changed its plans
for the investment several times. This led to a key schedule milestone
for replacing selected IMF functions, known as transition state 2,
being delayed 9 years—from 2014 to 2023.13

Significant Risks to Tax Processing, GAO-18-298 (Washington, D.C.: June 28, 2018).
12GAO-22-104387.
13Since we issued our report, IRS separated the transition state 2 effort to modernize
selected IMF functions into separate projects including the CADE 2 Individual Tax
Processing Engine and the CADE 2 Tax Account Management Individual projects.

• In January 2023, we reported on IRS’s legacy environment,
modernization plans, and cloud computing efforts.14 We noted that
IRS had documented plans for 21 modernization programs that were
underway, including nine associated with legacy systems. All 21 plans
addressed two of the three key elements that modernization plans
should have according to best practices. However, the plans for six of
the nine programs did not include plans for retiring the legacy
systems. Further, we reported that IRS had suspended operations of
six modernization programs, including two which are essential to
replacing the 60-year-old Individual Master File, and the completion
dates for these programs was unknown.
As a result of these and other findings in our report, we made nine
recommendations to IRS. IRS agreed with the recommendations and
described efforts underway and plans to address them. As of March
2025, IRS had addressed two of the recommendations and was
working to address the remaining seven.
• In March 2024, we reported that the agency had not included
historical program information and how quarterly performance
compares to overall program goals in its quarterly reports to
Congress.15 As a result of this and other findings in our report, we
made three recommendations to IRS. IRS agreed with the
recommendations and described efforts underway and plans to
address them. As of June 2025, IRS was working to address the three
recommendations.

Schedule. IRS reported on 28 programs associated with 190 projects
throughout fiscal year 2024 but made several changes to its
modernization portfolio during this time, by adding, removing and
consolidating programs. Specifically, the agency had 21 programs at the
beginning of the fiscal year. Subsequently, IRS
• added six new programs. In quarter 2 it added the Unified Intake Tax
Processing program, and the Automated Background Investigations
Systems Modernization program. In quarter 3 it added the Customer
Relationship Management, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure, Robotics
Process Automation, and IT Operations Transformation programs.
• removed the Legacy System Changes for New Unified Compliance
Organization program in quarter 2.17
• consolidated four programs intended to modernize the IMF into one
program named the IMF Modernization. The four prior programs—
CADE 2 Individual Tax Processing Engine, CADE 2 Tax Account
Management Individual, Self-Service Reporting and Analytics-
Individual, and Tax Account Management Services—will be tracked
as separate projects under IMF Modernization.
At the end of fiscal year 2024, IRS had 23 active programs.
To support its modernization programs, IRS reported that it delivered 190
projects during fiscal year 2024. Of those projects, 181 were delivered on
time and nine were delivered significantly late, meaning that they were
more than 15 days behind schedule. The nine projects are associated
with seven programs and ranged from 18 to 92 days late.18 IRS provided
16According to best practices, variances are expected because programs rarely perform
exactly to plan. Variances can be neither good nor bad but simply provide a measure of
how much actual performance has varied from the plan. GAO, Cost Estimating and
Assessment Guide: Best Practices for Developing and Managing Program Costs,
GAO-20-195G (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 12, 2020).
17While IRS removed this program, it reported that it would pursue some of the work on a
smaller scale.
18The seven programs associated with late projects are Business Tax Account, Enterprise
Service Management, Information Returns Modernization, Live Assistance, Security
Operations and Management, and Tax Account Management Services.

several reasons for the schedule delays, including contract delays,
service outages, and technical issues.
Cost. For the 23 IT modernization programs active at the end of fiscal
year 2024, IRS reported that it spent approximately $1.5 billion, $512
million less than originally planned. While, as previously noted, variances
are to be expected, significant variances warrant attention as they may
indicate underlying issues, including issues with how well programs were
planned and how well they are being executed.
IRS reported that of its 23 modernization programs, seven were on
budget, meaning they were within a 10 percent cost variance of planned
cost goals. However, 16 modernization programs had significant
variances ranging from 12 to 60 percent below budget.19 The largest
variance was for Business Tax Account with an underspend of $78 million
beneath its $129.4 million fiscal year budget, or 60 percent less.
IRS reported that overall causes for the significant cost variances for the
16 modernization programs included delays in contract awards, contract
changes, and labor changes. Table 1 identifies the amounts and causes
for the underspend for the programs.

2025. According to IRS’s reports, the delays and other reasons for the
underspend did not adversely affect the overall schedule or scope of the
work planned for the programs.
From fiscal year 2022 though fiscal year 2024, IRS reported spending $2
billion of the $4.8 billion in IRA funding appropriated for the agency’s
business systems modernization. In April 2024, IRS reported that the IRA
funding for business systems modernization was expected to run out in
fiscal year 2026.20 However, as discussed later in this report, in March
2025, IRS paused its modernization efforts in order to reevaluate its
priorities. This could potentially impact the spend rate of the funds
available in IRS’s remaining IRA appropriation.
At the end of fiscal year 2024, IRS had documented modernization plans

the modernization, and (3) details regarding the disposition of the legacy
system, if applicable.
As noted earlier, IRS had 23 IT modernization programs in its portfolio as
of September 2024. The agency documented modernization plans for
each of the 23 programs that mostly addressed the best practices. See
table 2 for a summary of GAO’s assessment of how IRS’s modernization
plans address the three elements. See appendix II for a detailed
assessment of each plan.

Of the 23 plans, 20 fully addressed the first two elements, including
milestones and describing the work to be performed to complete the
modernization, and three did not. These three plans partially addressed
the first two elements. Specifically, the plans did not fully identify the
milestones or description of work necessary to complete the
modernization of the system addressed by each plan. In addition, 10
plans fully addressed the third element by addressing the disposition of
legacy systems, three partially addressed, and two did not address it.
This element was not applicable for eight plans.

As previously noted, to implement the vision defined in the SOP, IRS
developed an Enterprise Transformation Roadmap that identified near-
term priorities for calendar years 2023 through 2026. In supporting
documentation and its project management tracking tool, IRS also linked
its modernization programs and projects to strategic objectives, goals,
and initiatives, as well as to outcomes and key results defined in the
roadmap, increasing the likelihood that strategic objectives and goals
would be achieved.
IRS Paused Its Programs In March 2025, IRS IT officials reported that the modernization programs
and Is Developing a New had been paused. They later noted that the agency was reevaluating its
investments and priorities. In June 2025, they shared an early draft
Approach
framework outlining nine initiatives designed to meet specific technology
demands, such as developing a unified application program interface,
reducing reliance on paper records, and improving taxpayer service. The
officials stated that the agency intends to pursue these initiatives in lieu of
the 23 programs it was working on as of September 2024. According to a
June 2025 Taxpayer Advocate report to Congress,24 to enable this
reprioritization, many projects continue to be paused or have been
canceled. IRS did not provide the broader strategic vision for the
framework, nor implementation details, but said it would continue to
evolve the framework through stakeholder engagement and cross-
functional coordination. In July 2025, the agency told us that the
Department of the Treasury and the IRS are developing new strategic
plans for fiscal years 2026 to 2030, which will replace the IRA SOP and
will align agency efforts with the current administration’s priorities. They
stated that Treasury’s Strategic Plan will be published by February 2026,
and IRS’s will be published by the summer of 2026.
As IRS fully develops its new IT modernization framework, it will continue
to be important for the agency to (1) align new initiatives with documented
agency strategic objectives, and (2) have program plans that address key
elements. In addition, for the 23 programs that IRS was previously
pursuing, it is also important that IRS consider the usability of the work
performed to date.
We provided a draft of this report to IRS for comment. IRS provided

written comments, which are reproduced in appendix III, and technical

findings and noted actions it is taking and plans to take to address these
findings. Among other things, the agency acknowledged the need to fully
address all three key elements of modernization plans as outlined by best
practices when finalizing plans for its modernization programs. IRS also
agreed that the work completed to date under the 23 programs included
in our review should be fully leveraged in its new modernization
framework.
Relatedly, the agency stated that it was actively reviewing the usability
and value of the work performed to date, ensuring that it contributes to
future efforts and provides a solid foundation for continued progress. In its
comments, IRS also noted that it had implemented 14 out of 18 past
recommendations. However, as noted in our report, as of June 2025, the
agency had implemented 23 out of 33 recommendations we made in the
four IRS IT modernization reports we issued since 2018.25 We continue to
believe the 10 recommendations are warranted.
We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional
committees, the Acting Commissioner of IRS, and other interested
parties. In addition, this report is available at no charge on the GAO

Methodology
Methodology
Our objectives were to (1) summarize the Internal Revenue Service’s
(IRS) reported cost and schedule performance progress for its
modernization programs for fiscal year 2024; and (2) determine whether
IRS’s modernization program plans are consistent with best practices and
aligned with its strategic vision.
For our first objective, we summarized quarterly IT reports to Congress
showing planned versus actual cost and schedule for the agency’s
modernization programs for fiscal year 2024. We also interviewed IRS IT
program officials to understand causes for variances between planned
and actual performance.
To assess the reliability of the performance data for the modernization
programs, we confirmed our understanding of the processes used to
generate the data by interviewing portfolio management officials to go
over the process for developing the quarterly reports. We also reviewed
and verified the data by comparing draft quarterly reports to finalized
quarterly reports to ensure all project data was accounted for. Further, we
followed up with officials to discuss any detected anomalies we found in
the performance data. We determined the data to be sufficiently reliable
for our purposes.
For the second objective, we reviewed our prior work summarizing
industry and government best practices for developing modernization
plans. We requested the agency’s modernization plans for the 23
programs that were active at the end of fiscal year 2024. We analyzed the
23 plans to determine to what extent they met the three elements of
modernization plans identified in GAO-19-471 that, according to best
practices, are needed to ensure program success.1
In addition, we reviewed IRS’s April 2023 Inflation Reduction Act Strategic
(IRA) Operating Plan (SOP)2 and related documentation to determine to
what extent IRS had aligned its technology objective with its
modernization programs. Specifically, we analyzed among other things,
IRS’s Enterprise Roadmap for calendar years 2024 to 2026, SOP annual
update and supplement, and modernization program data from the

Strategic Implementation Management System (SIMS) tool IRS was
using to track implementation of the SOP and progress of the
modernization programs. We determined whether these documents
aligned the modernization programs to the technology objective by
reviewing SIMS data to identify if the SOP objectives were linked to the
modernization programs. We also compared the SOP objectives to the
data in the roadmap. In addition, we reviewed early preliminary drafts of
IRS’s proposed organizational changes and new IT modernization
framework.
Near the conclusion of our review, IRS officials informed us that the
agency was pausing its modernization programs so that it could reassess
its priorities. We then interviewed officials and reviewed selected
documents on the pause and reprioritization.
We conducted this performance audit from May 2024 to September 2025
in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our
findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that
the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and
conclusions based on our audit objectives.

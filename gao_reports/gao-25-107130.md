Congressional Committees
For over 25 years, we have identified numerous actions that the Department of Defense
(DOD) and other federal agencies should take to improve outcomes of their most
complex and costly acquisition programs, saving taxpayers tens of billions of dollars.
Most recently, our work has emphasized the importance of structuring defense
acquisition programs around iterative development.1 This is a technical process crucial
to how leading companies develop innovative, value-added products on timelines
responsive to users’ needs. Correspondingly, in reports dating back to 2022, we have
recommended that DOD revamp its weapon system acquisition, test and evaluation,
systems engineering, and digital engineering policies to fully incorporate iterative
development and other leading practices.2 DOD concurred with many of the
recommendations but has yet to fully implement them.
Our work has also found that a sound technical process is not the only driver for leading
companies’ consistent pattern of product development success. Specifically, leading
companies employ equally robust business processes—applicable to the management
of individual product developments as well as to the overall product mix, or portfolio—to
initiate, justify, and prioritize their product investments. Understanding how leading
companies decide on their product development investments and how they use business
cases—the justifications for undertaking a product development—to support their
decisions can inform ongoing acquisition reform efforts by Congress and federal
agencies.
This report, the third of a series, responds to requests in three congressional reports
related to acquisition leading practices, weapon systems portfolio management, and

selected leading companies (1) employ portfolio management practices and (2) develop
business cases to guide product development investments. To address these two
objectives, we identified eight leading companies based on rankings in well-recognized
lists and awards, records of financial stability and success, and a history of successfully
developing portfolios of cyber-physical products—co-engineered networks of hardware
and software. We interviewed portfolio management and product development
representatives at each of those companies and analyzed available company
documentation. We then drafted summaries that synthesize each company’s key
portfolio management and business case development activities and shared these
summaries with the companies to review for technical accuracy. Table 1 identifies the
leading companies in our review.

Background
Iterative Development to Rapidly Meet User Needs
We previously found that leading companies prioritize developing and delivering new,
innovative products to customers with speed.4 To achieve this, the companies employ
iterative cycles of design, validation, and production to deliver a minimum viable product
(MVP)—one that includes the minimum capabilities needed for customers to recognize
value (fig. 1). Appendix II further details how leading principles guide the knowledge that
leading companies gain throughout product development.
Figure 1: Leading Companies Progress Through Iterative Design, Validation, and Production Cycles
to Develop a Minimum Viable Product
This iterative approach departs from the traditional, linear development approach that
develops hardware and software separately through a process of sequential milestones.
Over the last several decades, software developers have used Agile practices, which
provide iterations of capability that are continuously evaluated on functionality, quality,
and customer satisfaction to increase innovation and speed delivery. Now, as software
increasingly dictates hardware functionality, companies are developing hardware and
software together and are incorporating the iterative practices from Agile development
4GAO-23-106222 and GAO-22-104513.

into products beyond software. These systems of co-engineered hardware and software
are known as cyber-physical systems (or sometimes hybrid systems). Cyber-physical
systems—like satellites, robotic autonomous systems, and aircraft—combine
computation, communication, sensing, and actuation with physical systems, and their
functionality is controlled by software algorithms.
Table 2 describes some of the differences between traditional, linear and modern,
iterative product development approaches.

Before they embark upon developing an MVP, leading companies establish a business
case that supports their initial financial investment and underpins the start of a product’s
development. Our prior work found that leading companies then maintain the business
case and enable it to evolve as product development progresses.5 We also found that
leading companies engage cross-functional teams—including design engineers, domain
experts, cybersecurity teams, manufacturers and suppliers, marketing and sales teams,
and customers and users—throughout iterative development, applying their input on the
product’s design, for example.
Investments in Technology Development Portfolios
In related prior work, we found that leading companies take a disciplined approach to
organizing and executing their technology development activities by grouping them into
two portfolios: incremental and disruptive.6 Incremental development improves product
lines, whereas disruptive development is for riskier innovative and potentially market-
shifting technologies. Under incremental technology development, leading companies
align their research and development portfolio with product development, and product
developers begin funding early in the development process. For disruptive technology

development, leading companies demonstrate concepts to show their potential value to
stakeholders and secure investment in further development. Once a concept is proven,
leading companies iteratively develop the technology through a series of demonstrations
and feedback to inform improvements.
Key Terms and Definitions
This report references several basic terms related to portfolio management and business
case development, including:
• Business case. A collection of information and structured analysis that provides
justification for undertaking a program or project. A business case helps decision-
makers assess the potential benefits against the costs of the investment in the effort.
• Business segment or line. Part of a company determined by the products or
services it provides or the type of customer served and distinguished for public
financial reporting purposes. Business segments may include multiple business
units.
• Business strategy. The coordinated actions or decisions a company plans to
take to help implement the strategic vision, create value for the organization and its
stakeholders, and gain a competitive advantage in the market. Business strategies
are set at one or more levels, such as for a business segment, a business unit, or a
product line. For example, at the business segment level, a business strategy may
include plans for targeting certain growth areas in the market, while a business
strategy for a business unit may focus on extending or withdrawing specific product
lines from the market.
• Business unit. A separate department or team within a company that operates as
a part of the whole company. A business unit is a fully functional division—such as
commercial personal computer systems—with its own strategies, but its practices
typically align with the company's primary activities.
• Portfolio management. Centralized management of one or more product
portfolios, intended to achieve a balanced mix of executable product development
efforts. A product portfolio is a collection of products that a company offers,
managed as a group to achieve certain goals (i.e., portfolio goals) that align with
the organization's strategic vision (see below) and business strategies, which
communicate capability needs. In leading companies, portfolios are often defined at
the business unit level.
• Product definition. A description of what a company is developing for target
customers.
• Strategic vision. The desired future state of a company or other organization,
often expressed as a clear statement with a long-term focus.

Leading Companies Use Agile Portfolio
Management Practices to Guide Product
Development Investments
Leading companies employ a forward-looking, agile portfolio management approach that
enables their iterative product development processes. Through agile portfolio
management, leading companies continuously evaluate product development
opportunities and investments using three key recurring practices, as shown in figure 2.
In addition, leading companies rely on business case data for portfolio management
reviews and adjustments to ensure they remain responsive to market and user needs.

## Page 14

Agile Portfolio Management Enables Rapid, Iterative
Product Development
Leading companies have used portfolio management for decades to help ensure their
development efforts achieve good returns on investment and support their strategic
goals and objectives. In March 2007, for example, we found that successful companies
take an integrated, portfolio management approach to product development and assess
investments collectively from an enterprise level.7 These core principles remain
applicable to portfolio management in leading companies today.
Nonetheless, in our current work we found that leading companies have departed from
following the traditional linear, stepwise process to portfolio management that our March
2007 report highlighted. This traditional process centered on first defining the specific
components of a portfolio and performance metrics and then executing programs to
deliver on those metrics. Within leading companies, this approach has since given way
to agile approaches to portfolio management. These agile business processes for
portfolio management are fully aligned with and enable the rapid, iterative technical
processes leading companies employ to develop new products. Leading companies
regularly reassess market conditions, user needs, and technology advances and adjust
their product portfolios accordingly. Agile portfolio management helps leading companies
ensure that they continue to deliver relevant and innovative products to the market.
Leading companies generally define their product portfolios at the business unit level,
where they span one or more product lines typically related in a broad capability area or
technology, such as power distribution or 3D printing. See figure 3 for more detailed
examples.

## Page 15

Figure 3: Examples of Leading Companies’ Product Portfolio Structures
Like the technical process of iterative product development, agile portfolio management
relies on regular participation by key stakeholders throughout the process. Specifically:
• Senior executives, such as Chief Executive Officers, make decisions across
product portfolios, including target markets for future product lines and target
technologies to eventually integrate into multiple product portfolios.
• Business unit leads function as the portfolio managers and are
responsible for managing the goals, priorities, and performance of their respective
portfolios.
• Product development teams and cross-functional representatives with
expertise in areas such as engineering, research and development, supply chain
management, finance, marketing, and sales regularly provide input to inform
portfolio-level decisions. For example, sales teams provide information from market
research related to customer trends; engineers help determine the technologies that
will be included in multiple products within a product line; and supply chain
management representatives participate in prioritizing products within a portfolio.

## Page 16

Companies Use Agile Portfolio Management to
Continuously Evaluate Opportunities and Investments
Through agile portfolio management, leading companies conduct activities in tandem
and on a continual basis to remain responsive to their strategic vision and evolving user
needs. This process entails evaluating market opportunities and identifying broad
capability needs, aligning product portfolios and responding to capability needs, and
prioritizing and funding product development investments (see fig. 4).
Figure 4: Leading Companies Manage Product Portfolios Through Recurring Processes
The following is a discussion of each of the recurring processes.
Evaluate Market Opportunities and Identify Capability Needs
On at least an annual basis, leading companies conduct an assessment during which
leadership—such as senior executives and business segment presidents—and cross-
functional representatives analyze market and technology trends and make long-term
business forecasts (such as 5 years or more). Leading companies also monitor relevant
developments in legislation, regulation, or industry standards that may influence the
types of capabilities that users are likely to demand in the future.
Through these assessments, leading companies determine the technological and
commercial areas they want their products to occupy, check the target areas for
alignment with their strategic visions, and update their business strategies accordingly.
The assessments help identify the broad capabilities that leading companies intend to
provide through their product portfolios. By anticipating the types of technologies and
Page 11 GAO-25-107130 Leading Practices


## Page 17

capabilities that users will need and aligning their business strategies, leading
companies help ensure their product portfolios stay relevant as the technological and
business environments evolve. For example, Dell conducts market research to
understand customer needs, tracks technology trends, and leverages engineers across
different departments to identify future technology opportunities. It then connects the
needs and trends to establish a set of technological incubations that it plans to develop
for product portfolios. Drawing from market assessments and user feedback on
individual product development efforts, HP reassesses customer needs during its annual
strategic review to determine whether it needs to pivot its 5-year strategy to more closely
align with the market and the company’s mission.
Connecting with Future Needs and Technologies
Siemens holds a strategic foresight forum every year to identify future technology
trends for the next 3 to 5 years and avoid missed opportunities. Siemens conducts
ongoing monitoring of technology advances throughout the year, then uses the
annual forum to assess future capabilities and lay the groundwork for actionable
planning. It distills hundreds of identified trends into a handful of trends on which it
performs a deep dive analysis to generate ideas for predevelopment. Siemens
revisits its trend decisions on a quarterly basis to determine whether they remain
relevant and may add to its core technologies if it identifies new trends that are
important to its strategic vision.
Source: GAO analysis of Siemens information. | GAO-25-107130
Align Portfolios and Respond to Capability Needs
To implement the business strategies that address future capability needs, leading
companies regularly assess their existing product portfolios and develop plans for
addressing any gaps between the business strategies and intended products. At least
twice a year, portfolio managers and cross-functional representatives revisit portfolio
goals and make updates to align them with business strategies. Portfolio managers take
a holistic, near-term view of their portfolios—such as for the next 3 years—and compare
them with updated portfolio goals. For example, Google applies its “objectives and key
results” process of setting goals and tracking measurable progress to its product
portfolios. Under this process, product managers identify their product priorities, which
must align with the company’s global objectives, early in the budget cycle each year.
Danfoss evaluates product portfolios on their performance, alignment with strategy, and
coverage of market gaps and changes. These reviews may lead to broader structural
changes in a company’s portfolios, such as the installment of a new product line to fill a
gap in the market or modification of an existing product line to incorporate new trends
like electrification.
In addition, leading companies identify the technologies that will help deliver the critical
capabilities in their product portfolios. They undertake new technology development

efforts with the intention of integrating the technology into a portfolio of products that
ultimately land in users’ hands.8 Further, they consider technology maturity from a
strategic, portfolio-wide view and aim to identify the benefits of technology development
efforts across planned products and product lines. For example, Qualcomm aims to
converge on a particular technology that can serve multiple products and determine the
maturity to which the company would like to develop it before inserting it into products.
Portfolio management reviews, in turn, can lead to plans to incorporate new
technologies across product portfolios to build a company’s presence in a new market.
For example, if a company identifies new use cases for a technology that is already
serving another market, the relevant business unit can propose business cases for new
products that apply the technology for those use cases.
Technology Development Influences Product Portfolios
With technology at the center of HP’s product portfolios, it implements parallel
processes for technology development and product development, which link up
once technologies are ready for transition into products. While HP intends to include
every new technology in a product, it invests in early technologies that do not have a
clear product at first but are likely to serve multiple products once developed, such
as its fifth-generation microfluidics technology (the study of the behavior and control
of fluid on a microscopic scale). With its active technology development process, HP
can task engineers with finding the optimal and soonest available technologies to
insert into its products.
Source: GAO analysis of HP information. | GAO-25-107130
In their product portfolios, leading companies seek an appropriate mix of more
predictable, less risky product developments and riskier product developments that align
with their business strategies. Predictable product developments are those with a higher
likelihood of technical and commercial success because they include proven
technologies, have a reliable customer base, and reinforce the company’s market share.
Product developments with greater uncertainty may have lower technology maturity or
introduce a new market presence for the company but are critical to implementing the
longer-term strategic vision. For example, HP balances its core business portfolios,
which meet customer needs with currently available technologies in well-established
areas like home and office print businesses, with “new-to-world” products in developing
business areas that meet emerging customer needs. As a result, leading companies do
not establish one risk level to which all product developments must adhere. Instead,
acceptable risk depends on the risk profile of the entire portfolio—informed by risk
assessment data from product developments’ business cases—and the company’s risk
8While not a key focus of this report, in prior work we found that leading companies prove that technologies work before
integrating them into products. Depending on the type of technology development effort, product developers become
involved at different stages—early in the process for incremental technology development (focused on improving product
lines), and later in the process, after a prototype has been demonstrated, for disruptive technology development (focused
on riskier innovative and potentially market-shifting technologies). GAO-17-499.

tolerance. For example, on an ongoing basis, business segment presidents and portfolio
managers consider tradeoffs between products in the portfolio and the associated risk
levels in relation to the portfolio’s budget and strategy.
Prioritize Investments and Allocate Funds Within Portfolios
Within their product portfolios, leading companies aim to optimize their investments
across product developments. In line with the portfolio’s goals, portfolio managers
prioritize the individual products in the portfolio and allocate resources for product
development efforts based on the priorities. During the annual budget cycle, portfolio
managers examine financial objectives, such as sales commitments and profitability, and
evaluate individual business cases to determine which efforts to fund. Products in the
portfolio with top priority receive funding first, dependent on the budget allocation and
development milestone approvals that determine whether continued investment is
warranted. Leading companies will defer products with lower priority if enough resources
are not available to fund them, and the capabilities they expected to provide could be
delivered by other products in the portfolio.
The portfolio goals and related planning inform product development execution, but the
goals do not prescribe the detailed capabilities that the products in the portfolio will
deliver. Instead, the goals provide guidance for portfolio managers and product
development teams to follow when building business cases for new products. Portfolio
managers are responsible for determining how proposed business cases will help fulfill
the capability needs of the portfolio, while product development teams are empowered to
propose business cases and detail how they will deliver specific capabilities. For
example, at Qualcomm, a portfolio manager may observe how a technology is being
used for a Mobile product line and see a new application for the same technology in an
Internet of Things product line.9 The portfolio manager can then lead the business unit to
propose a new business case for an Internet of Things product that incorporates the
technology. Qualcomm’s product councils—advisory groups comprised of cross-
functional representatives that include portfolio managers—have visibility across
products and consider how technologies from different capability areas such as
communications, AI, and automotives can be applied to specific product lines.
Some leading companies provide portfolio managers with a certain amount of funding
that they can apply within the business unit without seeking higher-level approval. The
business units can then manage their product development efforts within their allocated
budgets. At HP, for example, portfolio managers prioritize and determine the projects to
be funded within their budgets.
9The Internet of Things generally refers to the technology and devices that allow for the connection and interaction of
“things” throughout such places as buildings, vehicles, transportation infrastructure, or homes.

Portfolio Management Relies on Business Case Data
for Reviews and Adjustments
Leading companies use information from business cases for product development
efforts to ensure they make informed portfolio-level decisions and maintain responsive
product portfolios. Examples of such information include user feedback on product
capabilities, how a development effort is contributing to portfolio and financial goals, and
planned delivery dates. These data are critical for portfolio management, as they help
leading companies determine whether they are effectively implementing their strategic
and portfolio goals. For example, while portfolio goals provide guidance on the broad
capabilities to be delivered, data from product development efforts provide feedback to
portfolio managers on the specific capabilities that users need and whether planned
technologies are sufficiently maturing to deliver them within planned time frames or
costs.
To help monitor the progress of portfolios, leading companies maintain product road
maps that provide a timeline view of the various product development efforts in the
portfolio over the next several years. For example, Danfoss develops different road
maps for efforts focused on new product development, product maintenance and
improvement and cost reduction, sales of existing products, and transitioning new
technologies into products. Dell tracks products on three different road maps—one for
early concepts, one for products that are in development, and one for products in line to
launch within about 6 months. Using these product road maps, portfolio managers can
identify and assess interdependencies between product development efforts within and
across portfolios, such as the development of common product components and
technologies and how to coordinate available resources.
As leading companies execute product development efforts, portfolio managers regularly
review and update their road maps and the associated portfolios. At least twice yearly—
and as needed in between based on changes in the market or expected product
development progress—portfolio managers, product development teams, and cross-
functional representatives revisit the ranking of the products in their portfolios and the
business case data that support them. This may mean that products within the portfolio
are reprioritized, paused, or canceled because of their progress and relative importance
in contributing to the portfolio goals. Portfolio managers can then redirect the resources
to efforts that are higher priority or present a more reliable path to success. For example:
• Based on assessments of business case data, Danfoss's portfolio managers may
decide to provide additional resources to improve weaker performing products;
discontinue outdated products that impede demand for updated versions; or continue
supporting an older product to maintain the loyalty of significant customers.
Page 15 GAO-25-107130 Leading Practices


## Page 21

• Based on reviews of sales data, HP may decide to replace an older product that is
underutilized due to an overpopulated market with another product that can take
advantage of the current, best technology.
Portfolio managers also conduct reviews of their portfolios on a more frequent basis,
such as monthly or bimonthly, to identify challenges and opportunities across products
and further optimize the portfolio. For example, portfolio management reviews may
reveal
• specific capabilities or features in one product that another product in the portfolio
can leverage;
• fixes for quality issues with a common component or technology that affects multiple
products in the portfolio; or
• new uses in products with higher priority for technologies from canceled products.

Leading Companies Use Iterative Business
Cases to Inform Scaled Investment in a
Product’s Development
Leading companies recognize that traditional business processes are ill-suited to
support the rapid, iterative technical approaches that guide modern product
development. Consequently, these companies have implemented iterative business
processes, including for product business cases themselves. Leading companies now
ensure that initial business cases for new products address four key elements—market
and user needs, product definition, internal value, and target schedule. These
companies then update these data throughout product development to inform recurring
decisions on product priorities. Importantly, they scale their investment in a product’s
development based on the pace at which that product’s business case matures, rather
than on promised performance or the passage of time. We determined that leading
product development companies rely on 14 practices to develop iterative business
cases, as detailed in figure 5.
Page 17 GAO-25-107130 Leading Practices


## Page 23

Figure 5: Fourteen Leading Practices for Iterative Business Case Development
Page 18 GAO-25-107130 Leading Practices


## Page 24

Iterative Product Development Necessitated a New
Approach to Business Case Development
Traditionally, leading companies developed and matured business cases for new
products prior to embarking on development, as we have found since 1998.10 Under this
approach, leading companies sought to fully define a new product’s performance
requirements and match up the resources (i.e., people, technology, time, and money)
needed to develop a product that met those requirements. A common output associated
with such business cases was a cost, schedule, and performance baseline that leading
companies used to monitor and oversee progress of the product’s development. A key
attribute of these baselines was a full commitment at development start to sustain time-
phased investments in the product’s development based on a promised pace of
technical achievement.
This traditional approach to business case development complemented the traditional,
linear-based technical process for product development. As our recent work found
though, the nature of modern products—and the technical processes leading companies
use to develop them—have changed dramatically over the past 20 years. Innovative,
complex products are now software-defined and only enabled by their hardware.
Correspondingly, iterative development approaches that leading companies used to rely
on exclusively for software development now guide the full product development
process.
In this environment, leading companies have restructured how they develop and
maintain business cases for new products. Leading companies no longer set nor rely on
a singular, static business case for a product’s development—one that defines and locks
in a product’s cost, schedule, and performance baseline at development start. Rather, as
further detailed below, leading companies develop an initial business case and then
iterate on it over the course of a product’s development to ensure it always reflects
current technical and business realities. This approach goes hand in hand with the
scaled investment approach—based on demonstrated progress rather than a promise or
the passage of time—that leading companies rely on to fund their product development
efforts.

Four Key Elements Comprise an Iterative Business
Case
Leading companies input multiple data points and metrics into their iterative business
cases to provide portfolio managers and business unit leads with consistent, accurate
data about a product’s development. Ultimately, a business case should justify a
company’s investment and deliver a well-defined product that aligns with the relevant
portfolio goals and the company’s strategic vision. Leading companies we reviewed
formulate their business cases around four key elements, summarized in table 3 and
further detailed below. Companies set different targets for metrics within each business
case element, depending on the balance of products in the portfolio.
Table 3: Key Elements of an Iterative Business Case
Element Description
Market and user needs Statement of a problem to be addressed to meet customer and
user needs
Product definition Describes the capabilities the product will provide, with increasing
specificity over time, based on knowledge gained through iterations
Internal value Describes the costs and benefits to developing the product,
expressed through, for example, the product’s fit with the
company’s strategic vision and portfolio goals
Target schedule Best estimate of expected delivery dates and available schedule
margin for a minimum viable product
Source: GAO analysis of leading company information. | GAO-25-107130
Market and User Needs
Companies consider market and user needs through a statement of the problem to be
addressed or the high-level capability needs the product will provide. In an iterative
business case, this is initially a broadly defined statement of objectives rather than an
overly prescriptive description of detailed technical requirements. This element also
identifies the expected market and users the product will serve. For example, NVIDIA
first clearly defines the problem it wants to solve and scopes it to an addressable need
but is willing to adjust the solution as the problem evolves.
Through extensive market research and customer input, companies quantify as many
elements as possible, including target market, expected users, and pain points the
product will address. As knowledge about the product grows, user needs become more
clearly defined and leading companies can validate assumptions about user needs.
Page 20 GAO-25-107130 Leading Practices


## Page 26

Product Definition
In the initial business case, companies define the high-level capabilities the product will
provide, including its basic technical functions and features and key technologies. These
high-level capabilities provide a point of departure for defining specific product attributes
and are informed by the following:
• Technology readiness assessment. Companies assess technological
readiness using, for example, technology readiness levels (TRL) or other measures
that gauge the probability of technical success.11 These assessments inform the
level of effort required to fully develop a technology before the product goes to
market.
Leading companies run separate technology development processes that begin with
technologies in the pre-concept stage, when developers may or may not have a clear
sense of the intended product. Because of this variation, leading companies initiate
business cases for new products in their product development lines (products in
search of technologies) as well as in their technology development lines
(technologies in search of products). For example, HP seeks to align its technology
development and product development processes so that a technology is ready to
merge into product development when the product is ready for it.
For most new product developments, leading companies seek to include only those
technologies that will be mature by the time product development begins in earnest.
For example, Siemens requires the technologies in its business cases to
demonstrate a TRL 7—the point at which the technology is proven and ready to
transition to product development—to be approved.
Mature technologies are the foundation to rapidly progressing through product
development. However, in limited but strategic circumstances, leading companies
are willing to make exceptions and allow for a lower level of technology readiness if
there is a compelling business reason that warrants this higher level of risk. For
example, the portfolio may include other products with much greater certainty that
balance out the risk, or the technology in question may offer significant benefits
across multiple products and, therefore, merit dedicated resources to develop it.
Because of this variability, technology readiness becomes a critical component to
monitor as product development progresses, which we discuss in further detail in a
subsequent section.
• Supply chain assessment, including make or buy decisions. Leading
companies assess whether they will have product components when needed and
whether they will develop or acquire the needed technologies. For example, Dell
11TRLs are a scale of nine levels used to measure a technology’s progress, starting with paper studies of a basic concept
and ending with a technology that has proven itself in actual usage in the product’s operational environment. For more
information on TRLs, see GAO, Technology Readiness Assessment Guide: Best Practices for Evaluating the Readiness
of Technology for Use in Acquisition Programs and Projects, GAO-20-48G (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 7, 2020).
Page 21 GAO-25-107130 Leading Practices


## Page 27

assesses products through a unit forecasting process, which determines, among
other things, whether the technology features can be manufactured and whether the
supply chain is sufficiently robust to produce the product.
• Relevant legislative or regulatory requirements and industry
standards. For example, to compete in certain markets, Google recognizes that it
must build in some features based on upcoming legislation and will consider if and
how it is feasible to do so. This may mean that Google deprioritizes some features to
prioritize others so it can compete in the market. Other products, such as those for
telecommunications, must meet industry standards to be viable.
Internal Value
Companies assess the internal value of developing the product, expressed through:
• Strategic alignment. The product’s fit with the company’s strategic vision and
portfolio goals, including how the product contributes to the company’s broader
capability needs.
• Benefit and opportunity cost. The benefit of adding the product to the portfolio
versus the opportunity cost of developing it over another product.
• Financial estimates. Metrics such as internal rate of return, return on investment
(of money, time, and other resources), target revenues, estimated costs, profit and
loss, and sales volume and prices.
• Commercial feasibility. Whether the company has the competitive advantage to
capture users in the market.
• Organizational readiness. Whether the company has the available resources
and skill sets to develop the product.
Leading companies assess metrics and inputs that affect the value of the development
effort for the company. For example, Dell evaluates how the product fits within its
strategic vision and the relevant portfolio strategy and whether the expected sales
volume, revenue, and margin will lead to positive returns. These metrics allow
companies to determine whether the product will be a good investment.
However, leading companies expect value-related metrics to change over time. Return
on investment, for example, is a high priority for leading companies, affected by
numerous factors over the course of development. To manage this uncertainty, leading
companies generally do not use initial baselines (such as for cost and schedule) for
iterative development in the way they are used in a traditional linear development
approach. Rather than establishing firm and detailed baselines before development
begins, they make preliminary estimates that guide initial approval decisions and later
function as a reference point. For example, HP initially looks for a minimum 10-times
Page 22 GAO-25-107130 Leading Practices


## Page 28

return on investment, with the expectation that the scale of the return will gradually
decrease as development progresses. Danfoss retains early cost and schedule
estimates for comparison and learning but does not rely on these data to assess product
development performance over time. This is because the data are based on limited
information, which are input when the company knows the least about the product.
Target Schedule
In initial business cases, leading companies provide a best estimate of expected delivery
dates and available schedule margin. The product timeline is often a driving metric, as
being early to market is critical for a product’s viability and affects how staff resources
are budgeted. For example, Google aims to get an MVP to market as soon as possible
to understand how customers will value the product and to determine whether it should
continue with subsequent iterations. The timeline is informed by specific product
features, historical development timelines for similar products, and the estimated time
and effort required to progress the through the product development life cycle.
Leading Companies Compile Business Case Data to
Inform Decisions on Product Priorities
Leading companies ensure the business case data are comparable, current, and
accessible to all stakeholders. They organize the data in a structured format, such as a
spreadsheet or shared portal, and use standard measures and types of information on
each of the elements across the company. This approach enables senior executives,
portfolio managers, and product development teams to compare consistent types of
information across products. It also enables companies to quickly input any updates on
individual elements and assess their potential effect on the overall business case.
Business unit leads—who also function as portfolio managers and may be product line
managers, technology field managers, or program managers—assemble and maintain
the business case data. The business unit leads incorporate input from cross-functional
representatives across areas including engineering, procurement, finance, marketing,
manufacturing, supply chain management, and market research. Business unit leads
ensure the initial business case contains all four key elements with the associated risks,
uncertainties, and assumptions clearly identified.
Leading companies assess the key elements collectively, validate the business cases,
and prioritize those of new and active products. For example, Danfoss has an internal
team made up of representatives from the project management team, business units,
supply chain management, and system management that ranks business cases within
each portfolio. This helps Danfoss prioritize its investments.
Page 23 GAO-25-107130 Leading Practices


## Page 29

Danfoss Uses “Due Diligence” Reviews to Manage Business Case
Assumptions
Danfoss expects its early business cases to include assumptions, as some data will
not be available before product development begins. To manage this uncertainty
without stalling important efforts, Danfoss puts business cases through a “due
diligence” review by an independent cross-functional team. The due diligence
review is intended to validate the assumptions and ensure the quality of the
business case data, providing decision-makers with a realistic assessment of the
business case and minimizing bias. With the assumptions well-understood, Danfoss
can move ahead with approved business cases and reevaluate the assumptions to
remove risk as development progresses.
Source: GAO analysis of Danfoss information. | GAO-25-107130
Business cases that meet the needs of the portfolio and the key elements are
determined to be highest priority and are approved for initial development. Conversely,
business cases may be denied if they do not meet the parameters for key elements. For
example, if a business case is too expensive (internal value), it may be denied or
deprioritized until the business case becomes economically viable. Decision-makers
may also deny business cases if they indicate the technologies cannot be developed to
meet critical requirements in a timely manner and within available resources (market and
user needs, product definition, and target schedule).
Leading Companies Iterate a Product’s Business
Case Throughout Product Development to Guide
Scaled Investment
Continual Reviews and Updates to the Business Case
Leading companies iteratively review, validate, and update the business case on a
regular basis throughout the product development effort. This process sharpens the
business case to reflect knowledge gains that occur as product development progresses
and provides portfolio managers with up-to-date information about the products in their
portfolios. Throughout these reviews, companies ensure that the business case remains
valid and viable both independently and in the context of the portfolio.
Leading companies systematically build in reviews that can identify and sometimes avert
problems sooner in development. Business unit leads, product development teams, and
cross-functional representatives revisit the business case at least every 6 months, at
major development milestones, and more frequently as needed. Reviewers will ask
business units to further develop and evaluate business cases if they do not provide
sufficient information on the key elements. This agile approach allows companies to

curtail uncertainty and increase confidence in their ability to deliver products that meet
user needs as development progresses. For example, as part of Danfoss’s biannual
“heartbeat” review—an agile process in which business units assess the progress of
their product development efforts—business unit leads revisit the business case to
determine whether they should reorder the products in the portfolio to reflect changes in
priorities.
In between planned reviews, leading companies reassess and update the business case
accordingly due to changes in any of the four key elements discussed earlier. Business
unit leads, the product development team, and cross-functional representatives conduct
ongoing monitoring of the elements and draw from various sources for business case
data updates. Through the ongoing monitoring, leading companies ensure business
cases reflect a realistic picture of their viability by making time-sensitive updates to the
key elements. The following is a discussion of how leading companies do so.
Companies frequently interact with intended users to reevaluate capability needs on
Changing Market
individual products (e.g., direct outreach to customers and users, such as original
and User Needs
equipment manufacturers; customer and market research; advance feedback from
reliable corporate customers). For example, at Siemens, senior executives, business
unit leads, and technology managers revisit the business case between scheduled 6-
month check-ins to incorporate feedback from customers and other updates based on
input from cross-functional representatives.
Companies also continuously monitor the market to evaluate developing competition and
make changes as needed. For example, if there is a mid-tier market need behind the
approved product and then the market changes and the need no longer exists,
Qualcomm may decide to repurpose the product. In other cases, Qualcomm’s
leadership monitors product development over time to detect changes in features,
markets, or other elements that may require a formal review of the business case or lead
to exiting a product development effort.
As leading companies iterate a product’s business case, they translate high-level

capabilities into specific technical features and functions that the product will include as it
Definition
progresses toward an MVP (see fig. 6).
Page 25 GAO-25-107130 Leading Practices


## Page 31

Figure 6: Leading Companies Iterate Capability Needs into Product Requirements as Business
Cases Mature
Leading companies continue to define these features and functions until they arrive at an
MVP, at which point planned product capabilities become stabilized as deliverable
product requirements in the business case. For example, companies determine the
must-have, mission critical capabilities needed to deliver a valued product more quickly.
This may require trading off the nice-to-haves to ensure the product includes the must-
haves, which are the elements that make it viable and contribute to its functionality. If a
company determines it cannot provide the must-have capabilities, it will discontinue the
product effort.
Leading companies facilitate this process through ongoing engagement with customers
and users to understand their specific needs and increase confidence that those needs
can be met. For example, Qualcomm collaborates with original equipment manufacturer
customers—who develop their own products using Qualcomm components—and the
original equipment manufacturer products’ end users to determine the specific features
to include in individual products. As Dell begins to develop a product and the associated
plans become more concrete, it revisits the business case at least twice more to confirm
that its cross-functional teams have the adequate resources to develop the product with
the necessary capabilities in the expected timeline. Iterative cycles of design modeling
and simulation in the product development process provide product teams with the user
feedback they need to determine the specific features, functions, and performance
parameters of the product.12
As they refine their products’ definitions, leading companies also closely monitor the
progress of technology readiness and related factors. For example, they revisit the
manufacturing feasibility, cost profile, and supply consistency for included technologies.

## Page 32

In the rare instances where a lower level of technology readiness was accepted initially,
leading companies balance that initial flexibility with the discipline to commit to
production only when technologies are mature. They can accept the higher risk earlier in
the process because they do not promise a detailed set of requirements or make full
resource commitments before they have tested the product design and reduced
uncertainty. By the time the MVP is validated, the technologies have been proven to
work as planned in the fully integrated system.
As leading companies continue to iterate on the business case, market changes can

affect the value of the development effort or return on investment. Accordingly, leading
Internal Value
companies allow for acceptable levels of uncertainty while they continue to refine the
business case. They expect early estimates to change as they gain knowledge with
development progress and are cognizant of portfolio-wide developments that will affect
funding, so they maintain flexibility. For example:
• HP uses minimum threshold performance parameters and targets to monitor
engineering performance, which the company adjusts as its understanding of the
product concept evolves through development. HP does not establish a single
baseline but, instead, sets initial targets and continues to update them at key
development checkpoints, such as when HP formally commits to a development
effort and creates a plan of record. Importantly, the plan of record is not static-it is
refined multiple times in the product development process through reassessments
and 6-month updates of business models, investment returns, and strategies for
introducing the product to market.
• Danfoss holds milestones reviews, led by the business unit team lead, to update the
cost and schedule estimates to ensure products continue to align with the budget
and business unit strategy. Once the product has launched and sales have
stabilized, Danfoss compares these estimates with actuals.
Throughout the product life cycle, leading companies encounter developments that can
Adjusting Schedule
affect a product’s target schedule. While the target schedule may be approximated
initially (such as delivery by a certain quarter), leading companies expect to quickly
refine it as they mature the business case and commit to bringing the product to market.
As a result, leading companies are more likely to make trade-offs in other elements of
the business case before they consider adjustments to the schedule. They frequently
revisit the product schedule to assess whether development is on track to meet the
estimated delivery date and make related decisions. For example, throughout a typical
1- to 2-year product life cycle, Dell revisits the business case at each of its six product
development milestones. At each milestone, vice presidents, product planners, and
cross-functional teams use the most recent business case data to decide whether to
continue, expand, or stop investment based on the product’s progress towards meeting
the schedule. HP also treats schedule as one of the most important elements. It
conducts an initial sensitivity analysis (e.g., testing outcomes if the development effort
takes an extra year to complete), which it updates at each development checkpoint, and
commits to a schedule once it has demonstrated the product’s feasibility.
Page 27 GAO-25-107130 Leading Practices


## Page 33

Scale Investments as Product Development Progresses
Continued iteration of the business case allows companies to mature its key elements,
which raises companies’ confidence in the product’s viability and directly informs scaled
investment decisions as product development progresses. Leading companies use their
frequent reassessments of the business case elements to determine whether to continue
investing in the product development effort. As a result, there are fewer instances for a
company to “fail slow” in the sense of spending significant time and resources on an
effort that ultimately does not make it into users’ hands. Instead, companies can “fail
fast” by stopping non-viable efforts before major investments; redirecting efforts if
appropriate; or pausing them until a later time when market and other conditions are
more favorable. For example, leading companies can discontinue a product
development effort if it becomes clear that the development risk is insurmountable and
the necessary return on investment cannot be achieved. When companies decide to
discontinue efforts, the portfolio manager assesses how other products in the portfolio
can address the capability needs that the discontinued product planned to meet. Figure
7 shows how leading companies’ decisions to invest in a product’s development reflect
the maturity of the business case.
Page 28 GAO-25-107130 Leading Practices


## Page 34

Figure 7: Leading Companies Scale Product Development Investment as the Business Case Evolves
Leading companies make significant investment commitments at key points in the
evolution of the business case and product development. For example:
• Before approval of the initial business case, leading companies invest
only a small number of resources. These resources typically go toward activities that
precede and inform the initial business case. For example, HP typically allocates a
small portion of annual revenue—roughly 3 percent in recent years—toward
exploring how new technology concepts can be used in potential products. As HP
matures these technologies and connects them to a viable business case, it
allocates dedicated resources for further development.
• After approval of the initial business case, leading companies commit
engineering resources to begin product design. This is when Siemens, for example,
begins integrating mature technologies to form a product and assigns funding and
management responsibilities to the business units.
Page 29 GAO-25-107130 Leading Practices


## Page 35

• Before prototyping an MVP, the product development team seeks to establish
that the design aligns with product priorities for capabilities, schedule, and cost.
Once confirmed, leading companies increase staffing and allocate additional funding
to engineering. For example, once Qualcomm commits to a product development, it
designates the effort as a program of record, allocates dedicated funding, and
increases resource investments significantly.
• After validating an MVP, leading companies make their maximum staffing
allocation and commit to production. For example, Danfoss releases significant
investments once key project requirements are finalized for production line
equipment.
Leading companies slow the pace of their business case iterations once the product
begins production. While there is no “final” business case, updates to the business case
significantly decelerate as product development reaches this point. Specific user needs,
product features, costs, and technologies for the product iteration are considerably less
likely to change after production starts. In rare cases, such as sudden market changes,
including a new competitive entrant or regulatory reforms, leading companies make
further updates to the business case after they validate the MVP.
Even after business cases reach a mature state, leading companies continue to revisit
them for current and legacy products to determine whether to maintain the products or to
discontinue them and move to the next iteration. For example, in deciding which
products to prioritize, Danfoss may determine a product has reached its useful market
end and needs to be replaced with another effort.
Leading companies use agile portfolio management and business case development
because the technical process of iterative development demands a flexible and
responsive business process. These leading practices can therefore be instructive for
government agencies as they seek to incorporate iterative development in government
acquisitions.13 We have ongoing work that is applying these leading practices criteria to
evaluate Department of Defense weapon system acquisition policies, programs, and
performance.

Appendix I: Objectives, Scope, and
Methodology
This report examines how selected leading companies (1) employ portfolio management
practices; and (2) develop business cases to guide product development investments.
For both objectives, we reviewed selected chapters of our Agile Assessment Guide for
contextual information related to federal contracting and program controls for Agile
development.14 We also reviewed selected standards and guides from the Project
Management Institute for background information on portfolio, project, risk, and
requirements management.15
We conducted interviews with representatives knowledgeable about portfolio
management and business case development—such as vice presidents, senior
directors, portfolio managers, and product managers—from eight leading companies
across a variety of industries. We discussed oversight structures of individual product
development and portfolio management efforts, how products are prioritized, internal
resource management, and business case development, among other things.
We selected these companies in part because they received rankings as leaders in well-
recognized lists; were recommended by outside experts; or were identified through our
background research, such as in prior GAO reports. Further, the companies all manage
a diverse portfolio of product offerings; have a record of successfully developing and
delivering two or more cyber-physical products; and use an iterative approach for
product development. In addition, these companies are generally financially successful
and well established, demonstrated by positive average total revenue growth over a 5-
year period (2019–2023) for publicly traded companies, total funding amounts and type
of funding for privately held companies, and credit grades under Bloomberg’s Corporate
Default Risk Model for Public Firms. Bloomberg’s model estimates forward-looking real-
world default probabilities for publicly traded firms and assigns credit grades based on
the estimated default probabilities.
In addition, we sought to include companies in a range of industries to reflect the
variation in the types of systems that government agencies acquire. We considered
other background information such as recent media reports; whether the company had
any government exclusions, proceedings or investigations; and whether the company is
a top federal government contractor. These factors did not necessarily lead us to
exclude a company but rather functioned as contextual information to inform an
aggregated view of the companies and distinguish between them, as appropriate.

Nov. 28, 2023).
15We reviewed, for example, Project Management Institute, The Standard for Project Management and A Guide to the
Project Management Body of Knowledge, 7th ed. (Newtown Square, Pa.: Project Management Institute, Inc., 2021); The
Standard for Risk Management in Portfolios, Programs, and Projects (Newtown Square, Pa.: Project Management
Institute, Inc., 2019); and The Standard for Portfolio Management, 4th ed. (Newtown Square, Pa.: Project Management
Institute, Inc., 2017).

We researched awards to commercial companies for excellence in performance,
business achievements, and innovation, as well as lists that reflect top companies based
on innovation and financial performance metrics. The awards and lists we identified were
published between 2022 and 2023 and include:
• America's Most Innovative Companies (Fortune Magazine)
• American Business Awards® (Stevie® Awards)
• BIG Innovation Awards (Business Intelligence Group)
• Boston Consulting Group's Most Innovative Companies
• CEOWORLD 200 Most Influential and Innovative Companies
• CES Innovation Awards
• Globee® Awards for American Business
• Innovation Research Interchange Excellence in Innovation Award
• Outstanding Corporate Innovator Award (Product Development and Management
Association)
• Fast Company's Most Innovative Companies (Fast Company)
We analyzed the responses from company representatives and available company
documentation, and we organized their statements and information by common themes.
We developed company summaries based on our interviews with company
representatives, which we used to identify the approaches and specific practices used
by leading companies for portfolio management and business case development.
Although we found modest differences among leading companies in terms of how they
implement agile portfolio management and iterative business case development, the
core processes, structures, and goals detailed throughout this report proved consistent
across all eight of the companies in our scope.
To validate our analysis, we shared summaries of each company’s information with their
representatives and solicited their feedback to incorporate technical corrections and
make adjustments as appropriate to avoid presenting company proprietary data. The
following companies are included in our review:
• Alphabet, Inc. (Google) provides diverse products and platforms worldwide. These
products address a wide range of use cases, including internet search, email,
navigation, cloud computing, web browsing, video sharing, productivity, operating
systems, cloud storage, language translation, photo storage, video calling, smart
home, smartphones, wearable technology, music streaming, video on demand, AI,
machine learning application programming interfaces, and AI chips.
• Danfoss provides fluid control equipment, pumps, seals, valves, and climate and
energy products, such as solar-power equipment and heat pumps. It develops

Additionally, we identified and met with cognizant experts in portfolio management,
product development, innovation, and science and technology policy from academia to
further our understanding on specific practices.
We conducted our work from October 2023 to September 2025 in accordance with all
sections of GAO’s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to our objectives. The
framework requires that we plan and perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and
appropriate evidence to meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our
work. We believe that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted,
provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions in this product.

The Honorable Mike Rogers

The Honorable Adam Smith
Ranking Member
Committee on Armed Services
House of Representatives
The Department of Defense (DOD) is the single largest customer in the
nation’s personal property moving and storage industry, representing
approximately 15 percent of all domestic and international moves. Each
year, the U.S. Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), through the
Defense Personal Property Program (DP3), arranges for the worldwide
movement and storage of approximately 300,000 personal property
shipments of service members and their families, at an annual cost of
approximately $2 billion, according to TRANSCOM officials.
As a result of widespread dissatisfaction with DOD’s relocation program
and calls for change from military families and congressional leaders,
TRANSCOM awarded the Global Household Goods Contract (GHC),
worth up to $17.9 billion over approximately 9 years, to a single
commercial move manager, HomeSafe Alliance, in November 2021.1 The
GHC was intended to improve satisfaction with military moves through
better quality, capacity, and customer experience, and TRANSCOM
previously reported that savings from the GHC could be as much as $2
billion over 5 years. According to TRANSCOM, cost savings was not a
primary goal of the GHC. HomeSafe Alliance was expected to oversee
activities related to the worldwide movement and storage-in-transit of
household goods for service members and their families. TRANSCOM
began implementing the GHC in April 2024. However, citing challenges
with GHC performance, the Secretary of Defense in May 2025
established a Permanent Change of Station Joint Task Force to develop
a strategic path forward for DOD’s relocation program. Subsequently, on
June 18, 2025, DOD terminated the contract, citing the contractor’s failure

to perform the services specified in the terms and conditions of the
contract.
The House report accompanying a bill for the Servicemember Quality of
Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2025 included a provision for us to review DOD’s management and
oversight of the GHC.2 In our report, we (1) describe DOD’s
implementation of the GHC and (2) assess the extent to which DOD had
the information needed to effectively oversee contract implementation.
To address both objectives, we reviewed relevant documentation,
including GHC documentation, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, DOD
guidance related to personal property shipments, and documentation that
described plans for GHC implementation. We interviewed TRANSCOM
and military service officials responsible for executing and overseeing
DP3 and the GHC, including the nine joint personal property shipping
offices executing GHC shipments. We conducted site visits at two
locations where the GHC was first implemented, which were among those
with the largest volumes of GHC shipments. We met with a non-
generalizable sample of about 40 moving industry representatives,
including the GHC contractor, moving companies, and industry
associations, and reviewed documentation on contractor capacity.
We also reviewed GHC performance and cost data. To determine the
reliability of the data, we reviewed supporting documentation and
interviewed knowledgeable officials. As a result, we determined that the
data were sufficiently reliable for reporting general information on GHC
performance and costs associated with the program. We also surveyed
service members and spouses on their experiences with the GHC, and
we received 1,217 responses.3 This non-generalizable survey primarily
asked open-ended questions about the challenges, benefits, and effects
on military families of moving under the GHC. We compared DOD’s
process for managing and overseeing the GHC to internal control
standards and key practices for evidence-based policymaking related to
identifying information requirements, determining corrective actions, and
leveraging evidence to achieve desired results.

but provide illustrative examples of these individuals’ experiences.

We conducted this performance audit from August 2024 to September
2025 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for
our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe
that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings
and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
Background
Overview of DP3 DP3, managed by TRANSCOM, arranges the shipment and storage of
household goods for service members and their families.4 When service
members receive transfer orders, they contact their local personal
property processing office to receive counseling on their allowances and
entitlements. With guidance from these offices, service members enter
their transfer and move information into the Defense Personal Property
System.5 As of 2024, over 800 commercial transportation service
providers participate in DP3 via Tenders of Service (ToS) to move service
members’ personal property, with many either relinquishing control to a
move manager or acting as move managers, according to TRANSCOM
officials.6 The military departments own, operate, and staff most of the
infrastructure involved in managing and overseeing the timeliness and
quality of household goods moves, including personal property shipping
4DOD Instruction 4500.57, Transportation and Traffic Management (Mar. 7, 2017)
(incorporating change 4, effective Dec. 11, 2024). DP3 administers government-
contracted shipping and storage programs for household goods and privately owned
vehicles for service members, the U.S. Coast Guard, DOD civilians, and their families.
The military services reimburse TRANSCOM for program and operating costs based on
the proportion of their personnel’s shipments administered through the program, according
to TRANSCOM officials.
5The Defense Personal Property System is a web-based system that supports the DP3
with management, invoicing, damage claims, and quality assurance of DOD personal
property shipments.
6Transportation service providers operate through “channels,” or combinations of origin
and destination locations, within and outside the continental United States. TRANSCOM
refers to its existing household goods shipment program—within the broader DP3—as the
tender of service program. A “tender of service” is an offer by a qualified carrier to provide
transportation service to DOD at specified rates or charges and is submitted to a central
authority for acceptance—TRANSCOM, in the case of household goods. See Department
of Defense 4500.9-R, Defense Transportation Regulation, Definitions (Nov. 8, 2019).

and processing offices.7 These offices work with transportation service
providers, move managers, and subcontractors to schedule moves,
oversee performance, and, when appropriate, take or recommend
punitive action for poor performance. The military services’ lines of
accounting pay the commercial transportation service providers, and the
military services reimburse TRANSCOM for costs associated with
program management, according to TRANSCOM officials.
Figure 1: Military Service Member Move
Overview of GHC In implementing the GHC, TRANSCOM planned to fully transition the
shipment and short-term storage of household goods under DP3, from
ToS to the GHC. TRANSCOM’s intended goal was to improve both
service members’ experiences with military moves and the department’s
ability to oversee and hold transportation service providers accountable
7According to TRANSCOM officials, joint personal property shipping offices are regional
offices that typically execute and oversee DOD’s relocation program within geographic
areas of responsibility. Personal property shipping and processing offices are installation-
level offices that execute specific functions within the program. For example, the
processing offices oftentimes provide counseling for service members on the relocation
process and the shipping offices conduct quality assurance inspections.

for providing quality service. Under the GHC, transportation service
providers, including move managers, would work as potential
subcontractors to the GHC contractor rather than working directly with the
military service shipping offices as they do in the ToS program, under the
DP3, according to TRANSCOM. The GHC contractor would work with
these providers as subcontractors to provide the capacity needed to pack,
store, and transport household goods shipments. Although the services
did not organize moves directly, according to officials, they continued to
counsel service members and monitor performance quality. Specifically,
the services were responsible for evaluating contractor performance
against GHC requirements and documenting and reporting results to
TRANSCOM. The services also directly approved invoices and
authorized payment for GHC shipments, as they do in the ToS program,
under the DP3.
In November 2021, TRANSCOM awarded the GHC to HomeSafe

small number of domestic, local shipments under the GHC in April 2024.
Terminated For example, TRANSCOM conducted about 100 local shipments at 15
locations from April through August 2024. It then slowly expanded the
number of locations and volume of shipments, and introduced intra- and
interstate shipments, coordinating with the military services, U.S. Coast
Guard, and the GHC contractor to determine when and where to increase
the volume of shipments moving under the GHC.9
From April 2024 through June 2025, TRANSCOM continuously delayed
implementation milestones and time frames in response to changing

Global Solutions, LLC v. United States, 162 Fed. Cl. 720 (Fed. Cl. 2022). Separate from
the initial challenges to the contract award, a lawsuit was brought in the U.S. Court of
Federal Claims in November 2024 alleging that changes to the contract should have
resulted in a new solicitation; the court dismissed the case as moot in July 2025 following
termination of the contract. Suddath Co. v. United States, 2025 U.S. Claims LEXIS 1185
(Fed. Cl. 2025).
9During initial implementation, TRANSCOM evaluated installations’ readiness, including IT
and staff training, and contractor performance to determine where and at what volume to
implement the contract. Officials stated doing so enabled them to identify and rectify
challenges on a small scale and better manage risks. By March 2025, TRANSCOM
reported that the GHC was technically operational for shipments to and from most
locations within the continental United States.

conditions regarding DOD site readiness and challenges with the
contractor’s capacity and performance, as shown in figure 2.
Figure 2: Changes in TRANSCOM Plans for Domestic Global Household Goods Contract Implementation
Note: TRANSCOM refers to shipments between locations within the continental United States as
domestic shipments. All shipments between, to and from locations outside the continental United
States, including Alaska and Hawaii, are considered international shipments. According to officials,
reaching 100 percent implementation meant managing all shipments for household goods across all
locations under the GHC. GHC implementation for international shipments was likewise delayed. For
example, in January 2024, TRANSCOM estimated that international shipments would begin in
January 2025. By December 2024, TRANSCOM officials estimated international shipments would
begin in September 2025, and by May 2025, officials did not have an estimated time frame for
reaching 100 percent implementation for international shipments. Forty percent of DOD’s service
member moves occur during peak season, which, according to officials, runs from May 15 through
September 30.
TRANSCOM and service officials generally agreed that DOD site
readiness required functional IT capabilities and contractor capacity in the
area, and TRANSCOM officials stated that ensuring these requirements
were met in some cases delayed GHC implementation. Officials from
TRANSCOM, the services, and the contractor all acknowledged that
contractor performance issues were largely due to the lack of a sufficient
subcontractor network—also known as industry capacity—supporting the
GHC. They also stated delaying implementation time frames was
necessary to ensure a successful program transition.
Page 6 GAO-25-107771 Military Moves


## Page 11

According to TRANSCOM, as GHC shipment volume and geographic
coverage increased, so did instances of poor performance, such as late
or missed pickups and deliveries. For example, in 2025, the GHC
contractor failed to pick up over 3,300 shipments and deliver over 3,600
shipments on time. According to TRANSCOM officials, to mitigate risks to
customer service, TRANSCOM responded by issuing move task order
terminations, show cause notices, contract discrepancy reports, and
letters of concern regarding contract performance challenges.10
TRANSCOM also reduced the number of shipments assigned to the GHC
contractor by reverting certain geographic areas to ToS, according to
officials. For example, according to documentation from a leadership
meeting, in March 2025, TRANSCOM established a minimum lead time
required to assign shipments to the GHC contractor, and officials said
they limited shipments in locations where it was difficult to obtain
transportation service providers.
Officials stated they expected this strategy could improve performance by
better aligning GHC shipment volumes with the contractor’s actual
capacity. However, the strategy did not reduce delays in GHC
implementation and did not result in the contractor meeting established
performance requirements. According to officials, this was due to
inaccurate capacity information provided by the contractor to
TRANSCOM. Specifically, out of about 20,000 shipments initiated with
the contractor from April 2024 through June 2025, TRANSCOM officials
stated that they terminated about 7,400 orders due to the contractor’s
failure to meet performance requirements or lack of capacity to manage
the shipments. Given the low volume of shipments carried out under the
GHC, the department’s costs associated with invoiced GHC shipments
totaled about $24 million as of April 2025—one year after GHC shipments
began. In comparison, DOD annually spends approximately $2 billion on
global household goods shipments in ToS.
In May 2025, the Secretary of Defense directed the creation of a
Permanent Change of Station Joint Task Force, citing challenges with the
GHC. DOD ultimately terminated the GHC in June 2025. The Task Force
includes the Under Secretaries of Defense for Acquisition and
10A show cause notice is a formal notification from the government to a contractor

Under the GHC, contract discrepancy reports were considered punitive action against the
contractor and used to formally report, track, and resolve significant performance
deficiencies. Letters of concern were sent to the contractor to formally express concerns
about performance.

Capacity. TRANSCOM officials agreed that the contractor did not secure
sufficient capacity needed to manage DOD’s relocation requirements,
which thereby limited timely and effective GHC implementation.12
TRANSCOM obtained some information regarding contractor capacity,
but that information was not sufficiently accurate or comprehensive to
fully manage risks and provide oversight of the contractor’s capacity to
manage full DOD relocation requirements. The contractor was unable to
secure the capacity needed to fulfill contract requirements, in part
because of the following:
• Compensation for subcontractors was less competitive than
market rates for moving services. DOD acknowledged in a May
2025 memo that GHC prices were in general lower than market
rates in the ToS program, under DP3. ToS rates had increased
rapidly in the years since the GHC was awarded. Officials from
both TRANSCOM and the contractor stated that differences in
rates between the ToS program and the GHC made the GHC less
attractive for the moving industry and limited the contractor’s
ability to build a sufficient subcontractor network. According to
TRANSCOM officials, they did not have visibility into the rates the
GHC contractor paid subcontractors. Some moving industry
associations and companies we spoke with after the GHC was
awarded told us that GHC rates were too low to cover costs of
11Secretary of Defense Memorandum, Implementation Memorandum for Permanent
Change of Station Task Force (June 13, 2025).
12Under the GHC, the contractor was expected to use a network of subcontractors to
provide the capacity needed to pack, store, and transport household goods shipments.
Based on this model, the government would order moving services from the GHC
contractor, which in turn would coordinate with its network of subcontractors to carry out
individual moves.
Page 8 GAO-25-107771 Military Moves


## Page 13

doing business and that consequently many companies would not
carry out GHC shipments. Some companies that had carried out
GHC shipments told us they were unlikely to continue to do so
over the longer term, absent increases in their compensation from
the GHC contractor. Further, some industry representatives told
us some companies had already been or would consider exiting
the military moving market in anticipation that a full transition to
the GHC would make military moves unprofitable.13
• Service Contract Act minimum wage requirements raised
concerns from industry representatives.14 Moving industry
representatives we spoke with told us they were unsure of how to
apply certain requirements of the Act to their business models,
and that existing guidance is vague. For example, industry
representatives stated they had questions regarding compliance
for multi-shipment loads from, to, and through multiple, separate
locations with different wage requirements under the Act, or
whether companies would be able to continue employing
subcontractors and temporary labor, as they stated is common in
the moving industry. Some also told us the Act requirements may
be operationally or administratively burdensome for some smaller
companies and therefore discouraged participation in the GHC.15
TRANSCOM had identified capacity constraints as a risk to GHC
implementation and performance years before implementation. For
example, Logistics Management Institute developed a GHC business
13The GHC defined a process for adjusting contract prices annually to protect the
government and the contractor against significant market fluctuations. Adjustments were
expected to be calculated using market indices and executed via contract modifications.
According to officials, at the time of contract termination, DOD and the GHC contractor
were negotiating but had not yet executed a price adjustment. Officials told us that they
anticipated that such a price adjustment would have better aligned GHC prices with
market rates and therefore attracted more subcontractors for the GHC.
14Under this Federal Acquisition Regulation-based services contract, the GHC contractor
and subcontractors were required to comply with the McNamara-O’Hara Service Contract
Act of 1965, codified at 41 U.S.C. §§ 6701-07, which requires that contractors and
subcontractors meet certain minimum wage requirements based on the locality in which
work is performed, meet safety and health standards, and maintain appropriate records,
among other things. Specifically, the Act requires that employees performing services on
contracts exceeding $2,500 must be paid no less than the monetary wages and fringe
benefits required by the Secretary of Labor for the locality in which the employees are
working.
15The Service Contract Act requirements generally do not apply to contracts for the
carriage of freight or personnel by vessel, airplane, bus, truck, express, railway line, or oil
or gas pipeline where published tariff rates are in effect; see 41 U.S.C. § 6702(b)(3). DP3
falls within this exemption because it is governed by published tariff rates.

case analysis for TRANSCOM in 2020, prior to GHC contractor selection,
which identified capacity-related risks. In its report, Logistics Management
Institute recommended that DOD review the results of the analysis once
the department had selected a GHC contractor and better understood
that contractor’s specific capabilities. TRANSCOM did not conduct
additional analyses after the contract was awarded to reassess those
risks, but did take some steps to assess risks during GHC implementation
planning, such as establishing a risk management board, according to
officials. In addition, a January 2024 DOD report to a congressional
committee on GHC risk mitigation identified capacity-related risks but did
not specifically address how TRANSCOM would conduct oversight of
capacity to manage that risk as it implemented the GHC.
Despite identifying capacity as a risk to successful contract
implementation, TRANSCOM did not collect sufficient information to
conduct effective oversight of contractor capacity during GHC
implementation. The contractor’s June 2021 proposal provided some
information regarding how it expected to secure needed capacity.16
TRANSCOM obtained capacity reporting information, such as the number
of subcontractors and estimated number of shipments the GHC could
manage; however, TRANSCOM officials stated that the GHC did not
require DOD to verify those capacity reports.17 Further, TRANSCOM
officials stated that it was the responsibility of the contractor to obtain the
needed capacity, which was what the government paid for as part of the
contract.
The GHC did not specifically require the contractor to continuously
provide TRANSCOM detailed information on its capacity. TRANSCOM
officials stated in December 2024 they did not have access to business
sensitive or proprietary information held by the contractor, such as
detailed information regarding capacity. TRANSCOM officials stated they
later obtained some information on contractor capacity in February 2025,
after capacity issues led to poor performance, but that the information
16The GHC solicitation required offerors to address capacity as part of their proposals.
The selected contractor’s proposal stated it would leverage existing relationships in the
moving industry, secure additional committed capacity through incentives, and increase
effective capacity through route optimization.
17The contract required monthly transition reports during the transition period ending in
February 2025 to include a statement on the service areas, or channels, the contractor
was ready to assume. Transition reports contained some general information on the
contractor’s capacity but were not required to include details such as a list of moving
companies that had committed capacity to the GHC, or in-depth descriptions of efforts to
expand contractor capacity.
Page 10 GAO-25-107771 Military Moves


## Page 15

they received was limited. For example, they told us the contractor
provided TRANSCOM a list of potential subcontractors that had signed an
agreement with the contractor, but this list did not provide details on those
companies’ actual capacity or willingness to carry out moves.18 Further,
TRANSCOM officials stated that information on capacity that was
provided by the GHC contractor misrepresented the contractor’s capacity
to manage shipments. For example, TRANSCOM officials stated that the
GHC contractor had reported that it had the capacity to manage about
200,000 shipments per year, but the contractor was unable to
successfully carry out the roughly 20,000 shipments it was assigned from
April 2024 through June 2025.
Without accurate information regarding capacity to manage the risk to
contract implementation, the volume of shipments TRANSCOM ordered
from the contractor exceeded the contractor’s realistic capacity, resulting
in performance failures and impacts on military families. According to
officials, at the request of the contractor in February and April 2025,
TRANSCOM had to move about 6,700 shipments it had assigned to the
contractor back into ToS in order to meet the mission need for service
member moves. Military service officials told us this caused substantial
additional work for personal property shipping offices. TRANSCOM
responded to the contractor’s capacity and performance issues by
terminating some move task orders, preemptively moving some into ToS,
issuing show cause notices to the contractor, and ultimately terminating
the contract. As DOD identifies the path forward for its relocation
program, ensuring it obtains comprehensive information on the moving
industry’s capacity to meet DOD’s relocation needs would improve the
department’s program management and oversight.
Performance. The GHC contractor generally did not meet performance
requirements defined in the contract, according to DOD data, and we
identified some limitations in the information DOD collected as part of its
performance management process. TRANSCOM’s process for monitoring
GHC performance included monitoring nine key performance indicators
defined in the contract, including metrics for timeliness of shipment
scheduling, pickup, and delivery, and customer satisfaction, among other
things. TRANSCOM also established specific surveillance and quality
18According to the contractor, potential subcontractors had to sign a master service
agreement to obtain information regarding participation in the GHC, such as
compensation rates, although subcontractors that signed this agreement were not
specifically required to carry out any shipments under the GHC unless they chose to do
so.

assurance roles for TRANSCOM and military service offices. For
example, quality assurance evaluators performed inspections during GHC
moves.
TRANSCOM measured contractor performance on key performance
indicators for each shipment, as well as overall, at least every month.
According to TRANSCOM’s key performance indicator data, from January
through June 2025, the GHC contractor failed to meet the defined
performance thresholds for most key performance indicators, including
timely scheduling, pickup, and delivery, and customer satisfaction. For
example, according to DOD data, the GHC contractor picked up 64
percent of shipments on time, and delivered 58 percent of shipments on
time.
Additionally, we surveyed service members and spouses on their
experiences moving under the GHC and found that poor contractor
performance negatively affected military families. Survey respondents
identified some challenges with GHC moves, such as inadequate
communication with the contractor’s customer service representatives
about the status of shipments, delays in multiple phases of the moving
process, and decreased funding for personally procured moves.19 For
example, some respondents said their household goods arrived several
days to weeks later than anticipated, and that the contractor was unable
to provide answers regarding the status of their shipments. Some
respondents also stated they did not hear from the contractor to schedule
or confirm packing, pickup, or delivery, or that movers did not show up on
the date or at the time they were expected. In addition, some respondents
stated they incurred out-of-pocket costs to pay additional rent at their
origin location or stay in a hotel, or that their families had to stay in their
new homes for several days without their household goods or furniture
while waiting for their household goods to be delivered.
19Service members may choose to arrange their own household goods shipment, called a
personally procured move. The government reimburses the service member based on the
amount it would have cost the government to move the same goods through a contracted
carrier. Because the GHC contractor’s rates were lower than rates in the ToS program,
reimbursements for personally procured moves under the GHC may have been lower than
reimbursements received in previous years or in areas where the GHC was not active.

Figure 3: Examples of Survey Responses from Selected Service Members and
Spouses
Note: In June 2025, we conducted an anonymous, open-ended web survey of service members and
spouses on their experiences with the Global Household Goods Contract (GHC). Our anonymous
survey was designed to capture their views and experiences for illustrative purposes and results are
not generalizable. We received 1,217 responses.
While DOD regularly used key performance indicators and quality
assurance reporting from military service shipping offices to inform
decisions about contract implementation and ultimately termination,
Page 13 GAO-25-107771 Military Moves


## Page 18

DOD’s information and processes associated with performance
management had some limitations due to the following:
• DOD lacked comprehensive feedback on service members’
experiences with the GHC. TRANSCOM used customer
satisfaction surveys to collect information on satisfaction with
personal property moves in both the ToS and the GHC. Under the
GHC, service members electronically received up to five separate
surveys after completing each stage of their moves.20 However,
officials stated service members did not receive a survey when the
contractor failed to carry out or complete a specific stage of a
move. For example, they told us if a service member’s GHC move
was never picked up by the contractor and instead transferred into
ToS, that service member would not receive a survey regarding
the GHC contractor’s pickup services. According to TRANSCOM
officials, the customer satisfaction survey was intended to
measure only satisfaction with services provided. However, not
providing a survey to customers who had experienced such
failures limited TRANSCOM’s formal feedback on the full range of
experiences with the GHC. As a result, TRANSCOM lacked full
information on military families’ perspectives on the GHC and
therefore was less able to ensure its evidence was sufficient to
evaluate GHC performance on overall customer satisfaction, a
metric that was an important program goal for DP3 reforms,
according to TRANSCOM.21
• DOD faced challenges with the quality assurance processes
that affected performance management. For example, officials
from five of the nine joint personal property shipping offices we
met with told us they had less authority to intervene on quality
issues during a move than they did under ToS. They told us that
under ToS, they could provide real-time direction to correct errors
or unsafe conditions, such as the mishandling of household goods
during a move. However, some officials stated that under the
GHC, joint personal property shipping offices could only document
20These included surveys on a service member’s experience with pre-move counseling;
origin services (i.e., pickup); destination services (i.e., delivery); and damage claims.
21In November 2024, we reported that TRANSCOM did not sufficiently address or analyze
the risk of nonresponse bias in its customer satisfaction survey as part of the prior DP3
program. In March 2025, DOD indicated it would take a series of phased actions to assess
and address risks related to nonresponse bias for the survey with estimated completion
dates between January 2026 and January 2028. See GAO, Coast Guard: Better
Feedback Collection and Monitoring Could Improve Support for Duty Station Rotations,
GAO-25-107238 (Washington, D.C.: Nov. 18, 2024).
Page 14 GAO-25-107771 Military Moves


## Page 19

and report any quality issues to TRANSCOM, and TRANSCOM
would address those issues with the GHC contractor, who would
in turn take action to address problems with its subcontractors.
• Officials from joint personal property shipping offices
described challenges arising from data inconsistencies
across the contractor and government IT systems for the
GHC. For example, officials from five of the nine joint personal
property shipping offices we met with said scheduled packing and
pickup dates were sometimes different across IT systems, which
made it difficult to schedule quality assurance inspections.
Officials also said they had to take on extra work to determine
correct dates and ensure moves proceeded as scheduled, as well
as to develop workarounds for this issue.
As DOD considers next steps for its relocation program, ensuring its
performance management processes incorporate key information—
including comprehensive feedback from service members—and enable
effective quality assurance would position the department to more
effectively manage and oversee its program.
Costs. TRANSCOM lacked complete information regarding costs
associated with the GHC transition. Specifically, DOD incurred unplanned
transition costs, paid management fees for task orders ultimately not
completed by the contractor, and lacked clarity on how GHC costs
compared to ToS costs, as discussed below:
• DOD incurred higher costs than anticipated for the transition
to the GHC. Specifically, the contract included $54 million over 9
months to pay for administrative expenses and IT development
and integration needed to transition ToS to the GHC. However,
according to TRANSCOM, in February 2024, the contract was
modified to incorporate an amount up to an additional $60 million
over one year for these transition costs. According to officials, this
increase was due to the need for more time and further work to
fully develop and integrate IT systems for the domestic
implementation of the GHC and to address issues regarding
implementation delays arising under the contract. In addition,
officials from TRANSCOM and the GHC contractor we interviewed
provided conflicting perspectives about a need for additional
transition costs to develop IT capabilities for implementation of the
GHC for international shipments. The GHC contractor stated
additional funding would be needed to develop those capabilities.
TRANSCOM officials stated they did not plan to pay additional
transition costs for the international program, specifically because
Page 15 GAO-25-107771 Military Moves


## Page 20

the GHC performance work statement already required that the
contractor provide, maintain, and integrate an IT system to
manage worldwide household goods relocation services.
• DOD paid up-front management fees for work not
performed—specifically for shipments that were assigned to,
but ultimately not completed by, the contractor. Per the
contract terms, the services paid the GHC contractor an
immediate management fee of approximately $563 per move task
order for administrative costs associated with managing the
shipments.22 According to TRANSCOM officials, these included
task orders that were subsequently terminated by DOD or
returned to DOD by the GHC contractor due to inability to carry
out those task orders, meaning DOD had paid for work not
performed by the contractor. TRANSCOM officials stated that they
had issued a demand for payment from the contractor of about
$3.2 million to cover already paid management fees for about
7,400 terminated task orders. However, as of June 2025, the
contractor had appealed those task order terminations, litigation
was ongoing, and no reimbursement had occurred.
• DOD lacked clarity on whether the GHC would be more cost
effective for the department than ToS. Although cost savings
was not a primary goal of the GHC according to TRANSCOM
officials, in February 2023, prior to initial shipments under the
GHC, TRANSCOM reported to Congress that it expected the GHC
to save the department about $2.23 billion over 5 years. However,
in 2024, after initial shipments under the GHC began,
TRANSCOM officials had not determined the extent of potential
cost savings and reiterated that the goal was not cost savings but
improved customer experience for service members and their
families. According to officials, TRANSCOM conducted some
analysis to compare GHC and ToS costs but did not complete a
detailed analysis of cost differences, in part because cost
structures of the contract and ToS differed. For example, the base
rates differed in each program, and the GHC did not incorporate
22This shipment management fee increased each year of the contract. For example, in
base year 1, the fee was $557 and was increased to $562.55 for base year 2.
Page 16 GAO-25-107771 Military Moves


## Page 21

certain accessorial costs permitted in ToS.23 In addition, in August
2025, TRANSCOM officials stated that clarity on whether the GHC
would be more cost effective than ToS could not be determined.
Specifically, they stated TRANSCOM did not have enough time
between when ToS rates for peak season 2025 were finalized in
April 2025 and the GHC was terminated in June 2025 to complete
such an analysis.
At the direction of the Secretary of Defense, DOD is currently working to
develop recommendations for the long-term reform of and strategic path
forward for DP3. DOD is also considering additional changes to its
relocation program that include reductions in the number of military
moves and permanent change of station budgets. Greater clarity on cost
implications of all potential changes would help DOD make better
informed decisions regarding the future of the program.
Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that
management should identify information requirements needed to achieve
the objectives of a program and address risks, use quality information for
decision making, and evaluate identified issues and determine
appropriate corrective actions to remediate deficiencies.24 Key practices
for evidence-based policymaking include using and leveraging evidence
to understand why desired results were not achieved and to inform
decision making, such as changes to strategies to achieve better
results.25
DOD’s process for managing risks and overseeing GHC implementation
did not enable TRANSCOM to collect comprehensive information needed
for effective program management and oversight. Specifically, DOD had
not ensured its process for program management and oversight
incorporated comprehensive information on capacity, performance, and
costs. As DOD considers its strategic path forward after GHC termination,
23Accessorial costs are charges for additional services provided by moving companies
that can vary based on several factors such as size of shipment. According to
TRANSCOM officials, under ToS, DOD authorized accessorial charges for most services
that go beyond standard services, such as special handling for heavy items. These
officials stated that under the GHC, fewer separate accessorial charges were allowed and
the most common charges, such as for crating fragile personal property, were solicited for
and included in the contract pricing.

understanding and mitigating information gaps that negatively affected
GHC risk management and oversight would help inform DOD’s efforts to
identify changes needed for its relocation program to meet TRANSCOM’s
mission and program goals of providing high-quality moves for service
members and improving transparency and accountability. Ensuring there
is a process in place to obtain more comprehensive information on
program capacity, performance, and costs as DOD moves forward will
better position them and Congress to manage risks and oversee the
program effectively.
Implementing the GHC was intended to address challenges in DOD’s
Conclusions
existing relocation program by improving move quality, accountability, and
customer experience. However, DOD found that the GHC contractor was
unable to fulfill contract requirements, and sustained capacity and
performance challenges led DOD to terminate the contract after spending
millions. While the department had a performance monitoring and
oversight structure in place for the GHC, it lacked comprehensive
information on contractor capacity, performance management, and
program costs, which would have better positioned DOD to oversee
contract implementation and appropriately manage risks. DOD is
currently considering how it might move forward and improve its program.
As it does so, obtaining comprehensive information related to capacity,
performance, and costs will better position DOD to ensure it can
effectively oversee its program in the future.
The Secretary of Defense should—as the department develops its path

The House report accompanying a bill for the Servicemember Quality of
Life Improvement and National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year
2025 included a provision for us to review the Department of Defense’s
(DOD) management and oversight of the Global Household Goods
Contract (GHC).1 Our report (1) describes DOD’s implementation of the
GHC; and (2) assesses the extent to which DOD had the information
needed to effectively oversee contract implementation.
To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant documentation,
including GHC documentation, the Federal Acquisition Regulation, DOD
guidance related to personal property shipments, and documentation that
described plans for GHC implementation.2 We interviewed U.S.
Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) and Army, Marine Corps, Navy,
and Air Force officials responsible for executing and overseeing the
Defense Personal Property Program (DP3) and the GHC, including the
nine joint personal property shipping offices executing GHC shipments.
We also met with a non-generalizable sample of about 40 moving
industry associations and moving companies, including the GHC
contractor. We identified initial industry associations to interview based on
our prior work on DP3 and the GHC.3 From these interviews, we solicited
recommendations for additional associations and moving companies to
speak with. We also identified some stakeholders through our own
research. Moving companies we interviewed ranged in size—including
large national van lines and smaller, local movers—and in experience
with DOD moves and the GHC.
We conducted two in-person site visits at locations where the GHC was
first implemented, which were among those with the largest volumes of
GHC shipments. To develop our sample of installations for the site visits,
we reviewed a list of all locations where the GHC was implemented as of
December 2024. From that list we then identified nine joint personal

property shipping offices across the continental United States that had
begun carrying out GHC moves and had conducted at least one
shipment.4 From these nine offices, we selected our two site visit
locations—Joint Personal Property Shipping Office Northwest (at Joint
Base Lewis-McChord, Washington) and Consolidated Personal Property
Shipping Office Norfolk (at Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia). These
locations were among the first of these offices to begin carrying out GHC
moves and among those with the highest volume of shipments, based on
TRANSCOM data current at the time of site selection.
We conducted virtual, semi-structured interviews with the seven
remaining joint personal property shipping offices to obtain information on
GHC implementation in their geographic areas of responsibility, including
information on GHC benefits and challenges, and management and
oversight of the GHC at the military service and installation levels. During
the in-person site visits and virtual, semi-structured interviews, we met
with leaders at the joint personal property shipping offices, including office
directors, deputy directors, and supervisors of functional teams—such as
quality assurance, ordering, and invoicing.
For our first objective, we reviewed DOD and contractor GHC
implementation plans to describe DOD’s contract implementation in fiscal
year 2022 through contract termination in June 2025. We also interviewed
officials at TRANSCOM and the military services, including the joint
personal property shipping offices, regarding GHC implementation and
related challenges. Further, we interviewed industry association
representatives and moving companies, including the GHC contractor, to
discuss their perspectives on GHC implementation. We also requested
and reviewed information from TRANSCOM on the volume of shipments
under the GHC and contractor capacity.
For our second objective, we reviewed contract documents, as well as
DOD guidance and other documentation outlining requirements for and
efforts taken by DOD to oversee and collect information regarding
contractor capacity, performance, and program costs. We interviewed
TRANSCOM, military service, and industry officials to discuss the extent
4According to TRANSCOM officials, joint personal property shipping offices typically
execute and oversee DOD’s relocation program within geographic areas of responsibility.
According to TRANSCOM, the GHC was implemented at specific sites across the
continental United States—including joint personal property shipping offices—based on
shipment volumes, DOD shipping office capabilities and workforce experience, and
contractor capabilities.

Methodology
to which DOD had the information needed to oversee GHC
implementation. In addition, we interviewed the GHC contractor, industry
associations, and moving companies regarding DOD’s oversight of GHC
implementation.
Further, we reviewed GHC performance and cost data. Specifically, we
obtained and reviewed TRANSCOM data on the contractor’s performance
on key performance indicators defined in the contract and on GHC
costs—including costs for transitioning DP3 to the GHC and for
shipments carried out and invoiced under the GHC. To determine the
reliability of the data, we reviewed supporting documentation and
interviewed knowledgeable officials. We determined that the data were
sufficiently reliable for reporting general information on GHC performance
and costs associated with the program.
In June 2025, we also conducted an anonymous, open-ended web survey
of service members and their spouses on their experiences with the GHC,
including challenges, benefits, and effects. Our anonymous survey was
designed to capture their views and experiences for illustrative purposes.
The survey results are not generalizable. The survey asked primarily
open-ended questions about the challenges and benefits of moving under
the GHC, as well as the effects of those challenges or benefits for military
families. We pretested the survey with two service members and one
spouse to ensure questions were clear, interpreted consistently, and
answerable. We analyzed the survey for illustrative examples and quotes
regarding the challenges and effects of moving under the GHC. We
received 1,217 responses.
We compared DOD’s process for managing and overseeing the GHC to
internal control standards and key practices for evidence-based
policymaking related to identifying information requirements needed to
achieve the objectives of a program and address risks, determining
corrective actions, and leveraging evidence to understand why desired
results were not achieved and to inform decision making.5
We conducted this performance audit from August 2024 to September
2025 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to

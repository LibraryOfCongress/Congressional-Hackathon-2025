Chief Information Officer
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
200 Independence Ave., SW
Washington, DC 20201
Chief Information Officer Open Recommendations: Department of Health and Human
Services
Dear Mr. Minor:
I am writing to you with respect to your role as the Chief Information Officer (CIO) for the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). As an independent, non-partisan agency
that works for Congress, GAO’s mission is to support Congress in meeting its constitutional
responsibilities and help improve the performance and ensure the accountability of the
federal government. Our work includes investigating matters related to the use of public funds
and evaluating programs and activities of the U.S. Government at the request of congressional
committees and subcommittees, on the initiative of the Comptroller General, and as required by
public laws or committee reports. Our duties include reporting our findings and recommending
ways to increase economy and efficiency in government spending. The purpose of this letter is
to provide an overview of the open GAO recommendations to HHS that call for the attention of
the CIO.
We identified recommendations that relate to the CIO’s roles and responsibilities in effectively
managing IT. They include strategic planning, investment management, and information
security. We have previously reported on the significance of the CIO’s role in improving the
government’s performance in IT and related information management functions.1 Your attention
to these recommendations will help ensure the secure and effective use of IT at the department.
Currently, HHS has 82 open recommendations, 37 of which are considered sensitive, that call
for the attention of the CIO. Further, 49 of the 82 open recommendations are relevant to
component-level CIOs. Each of the 82 recommendations relates to a GAO High-Risk area: (1)
Ensuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation or (2) Improving IT Acquisitions and Management.2
1See for example, GAO, Federal Chief Information Officers: Critical Actions Needed to Address Shortcomings and
Challenges in Implementing Responsibilities, GAO-18-93 (Washington, D.C.: Aug. 2, 2018).

Effectiveness, GAO-25-107743 (Washington, D.C.: Feb. 25, 2025).

In addition, GAO has designated one of the 82 as a priority recommendation.3 Fully
implementing these open recommendations could significantly improve HHS’s ability to deter
threats and manage its critical systems, operations, and information. I have summarized
selected recommendations here. See the enclosure for a full list, and additional details on the
GAO recommendations, including sensitive but unclassified recommendations.
Ensuring the Cybersecurity of the Nation. HHS needs to take additional steps to secure the
records and the information systems it uses to carry out its mission. For example, we
recommended that HHS establish a reasonable time frame for when it will be able to digitally
accept access and consent forms from individuals who were properly identity proofed and
authenticated, and post those forms on the department's privacy program website. Until HHS
implements this recommendation, the department will not be able to adequately protect records
from improper disclosure.
We also recommended that the department fully implement all event logging requirements as
directed by the Office of Management and Budget. Until HHS implements this recommendation,
there is increased risk that the department will not have complete information from logs on its
systems to detect, investigate, and remediate cyber threats.
Improving IT Acquisitions and Management. HHS needs to better manage and track its IT
resources. We recommended that HHS complete its covered Internet of Things (IoT) inventory
within the revised time frame it had proposed.4 Given the enormous array of disparate devices
that may be considered part of IoT, it is important that HHS identifies and documents the
devices connected to its information systems. Until HHS implements this recommendation, the
department will lack visibility into the IoT devices in its enterprise environment and the ability to
mitigate IoT cybersecurity risks.
HHS also needs to develop a public health situational awareness and biosurveillance network.
This includes ensuring that the lead operating division, in developing the Pandemic and All-
Hazards Preparedness and Advancing Innovation Act of 2019 work plan, include specific
actions that can be completed to show progress in developing the network. Implementing this
recommendation will help ensure that HHS has the comprehensive capabilities needed to
respond in a timely manner to infectious disease outbreaks like COVID-19.
In addition to GAO’s recommendations, the HHS Inspector General also has multiple open
recommendations in the areas of cybersecurity and IT acquisitions and management. These
include cybersecurity recommendations that relate to the department’s requirements under the
Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014.5 It will be important to address both
GAO and Inspector General recommendations.
3Priority recommendations are those that GAO believes warrant priority attention from heads of key departments or
agencies. They are highlighted because, upon implementation, they may significantly improve government
operations, for example, by realizing large dollar savings; eliminating mismanagement, fraud, and abuse; or making
progress toward addressing a high-risk or duplication issue. Since 2015, GAO has sent letters to selected agencies to
highlight the importance of implementing such recommendations.
4Internet of Things generally refers to the technologies and devices that allow for the network connection and
interaction of a wide array of devices that interact with the physical world, or “things”, through such places as
buildings, vehicles, transportation infrastructure, or homes.
5The Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014, Pub. L. No. 113-283, 128 Stat. 3073 (Dec. 18, 2014)
largely superseded the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002, enacted as Title III, E-Government Act
of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-347, 116 Stat. 2899, 2946 (Dec. 17, 2002).

Copies of this letter are being sent to the appropriate congressional committees and the Federal
CIO. The letter will also be available at no charge on the GAO website at https://www.gao.gov.
In addition, we sent a separate letter related to department-wide priority recommendations,
which also conveys the importance of enhancing information technology and cybersecurity, to
the Secretary of HHS.6 We also sent a letter on key issues related to financial management in
the federal government to HHS’s Chief Financial Officer.7
If you have any questions or would like to discuss any of the recommendations outlined in this
letter, please do not hesitate to contact me at marinosn@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices
of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this letter. Our
teams will continue to coordinate with your staff on addressing these 82 open recommendations
that call for the attention of the CIO. I appreciate HHS’s continued commitment and thank you
for your personal attention to these important recommendations.

Enclosure
Chief Information Officer Open Recommendations to the Department of Health and
Human Services
This enclosure includes the open GAO recommendations to the Department of Health and
Human Services (HHS) that call for the attention of its Chief Information Officer (CIO), including

Federal agencies depend on IT systems to carry out operations and process, maintain, and
report essential information. The security of these systems and data is vital to protecting
individual privacy and ensuring national security. Table 1 provides information on the open
cybersecurity-related recommendations relevant to the HHS CIO.

Improving IT Acquisitions and Management
Federal IT investments too frequently fail to deliver capabilities in a timely, cost-effective
manner. Key management challenges—such as a lack of disciplined project planning and
program oversight—continue to hamper effective acquisition and management of the
government’s IT assets. Table 2 provides information on the open IT acquisition and
management-related recommendations relevant to the HHS CIO.

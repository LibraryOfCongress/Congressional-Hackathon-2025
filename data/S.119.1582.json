permitted payment stablecoin issuers;\n                    (II) do not exceed requirements that are sufficient \n                to ensure the ongoing operations of permitted payment \n

an \n            individual basis or by category, taking into consideration \n            the capital structure, business model risk profile, \n            complexity, financial activities (including financial \n            activities of subsidiaries), size, and any other risk-\n            related factors of permitted payment stablecoin issuers \n            that a primary Federal payment stablecoin regulator \n            determines appropriate, provided that such tailoring or \n            differentiation occurs without respect to whether a \n            permitted payment stablecoin issuer is regulated by a State \n            payment stablecoin regulator; or\n                (ii) any supervisory, regulatory, or enforcement \n            authority of a primary Federal payment stablecoin regulator \n            to further the safe and sound operation of an institution \n            for which the primary Federal payment stablecoin regulator \n            is the appropriate

   before taking any action to block and prohibit transactions \n            in property and interests in property of a foreign person \n            to ensure that the permitted payment stablecoin issuer is \n            able to effectively block a payment stablecoin of the \n            foreign person upon issuance of the payment stablecoin; and\n                (ii) is not required to notify

incidental thereto, that are authorized by the primary Federal \n        payment stablecoin regulator or the State payment stablecoin \n        regulator, as applicable, consistent with all other

     (5) Certification review.--\n            (A) In general.--Not later than 30 days after the date on \n        which a State payment stablecoin regulator submits an initial \n        certification or a recertification under paragraph (4), the \n        Stablecoin Certification Review Committee shall--\n                (i) approve such certification if the Committee \n            unanimously determines that the State-level regulatory \n            regime meets or exceeds the standards and requirements \n            described in subsection (a); or\n                (ii) deny such certification and provide the State \n            payment stablecoin regulator with a written explanation of \n            the denial, describing the reasoned basis for the denial \n            with sufficient detail to enable the State payment \n            stablecoin regulator and State-level regulatory regime to \n            make any changes necessary to meet or exceed the standards \n            and requirements described in subsection (a).\n            (B) Recertifications.--With respect to any recertification \n        certification submitted by a State payment stablecoin regulator \n        under paragraph (4), the Stablecoin Certification Review \n        Committee shall only deny the recertification if--\n                (i) the State-level regulatory regime has materially \n            changed from the prior certification or there has been a \n            significant change in circumstances; and\n                (ii) the material change in the regime or significant \n            change in circumstances described in clause (i) is such \n            that the State-level regulatory regime will not promote the \n            safe and sound operation of State qualified payment \n            stablecoin issuers under its supervision.\n            (C) Opportunity to cure.--\n                (i) In general.--With respect to a denial described \n            under subparagraph (A) or (B), the Stablecoin Certification \n            Review Committee shall provide the State payment stablecoin \n            regulator with not less than 180 days from the date on \n            which the State payment stablecoin regulator is notified of \n            such denial to--\n\n                    (I) make such changes as may be necessary to ensure \n                the State-level regulatory regime meets or exceeds the \n                standards described in subsection (a); and\n                    (II) resubmit the initial certification or \n                recertification.\n\n                (ii) Denial.--If, after a State payment stablecoin \n            regulator resubmits an initial certification or \n            recertification under clause (i), the Stablecoin \n            Certification Review Committee again determines that the \n            initial certification or recertification shall result in a \n            denial, the Stablecoin Certification Review Committee \n            shall, not later than 30 days after such determination, \n            provide the State payment stablecoin regulator with a \n            written explanation for the determination.\n            (D) Appeal of denial.--A State payment stablecoin regulator \n        in receipt of a denial under subparagraph (C)(ii) may appeal \n        the denial to the United States Court of Appeals for the \n        District of Columbia Circuit.\n            (E) Right to resubmit.--A State payment stablecoin \n        regulator in receipt of a denial under

in the Federal Register and on the website of the \n    Department of the Treasury a list of States that have submitted \n    initial certifications and recertifications under paragraph (4).\n        (7) Expedited certifications of existing regulatory regimes.--\n    The Stablecoin Certification Review Committee shall take all \n    necessary steps to endeavor that, with respect to a State that, \n    within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act, has in effect \n    a prudential regulatory regime (including regulations and guidance) \n    for the supervision of digital assets or payment stablecoins, the \n    certification process under this paragraph with respect to that \n    regime occurs on an expedited timeline after the effective date of \n    this Act.\n    (d) Transition to Federal Oversight.--\n        (1) Depository institution.--A State chartered depository \n    institution that is a State qualified payment stablecoin issuer \n    with a payment

threshold, transition to the Federal regulatory \n        framework of the primary Federal payment stablecoin regulator \n        of the State chartered depository institution, which shall be \n        administered by the State payment stablecoin regulator of the \n        State chartered depository institution and the primary Federal \n        payment stablecoin regulator acting jointly; or\n            (B) beginning on the date the payment stablecoin reaches \n        such threshold, cease issuing new payment stablecoins until the \n        payment stablecoin is under the $10,000,000,000 consolidated \n        total outstanding issuance threshold.\n        (2) Other institutions.--A State qualified payment stablecoin \n    issuer not described in paragraph (1) with a payment

threshold, transition to the Federal regulatory \n        framework under subsection (a) administered by the relevant \n        State payment stablecoin regulator and the Comptroller, acting \n        in coordination; or\n            (B) beginning on the date the payment stablecoin reaches \n        such threshold, cease issuing new payment stablecoins until the \n        payment stablecoin is
